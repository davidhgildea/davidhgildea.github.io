1 In the third year when Cyrus was king of Persia, something was shown to Daniel, who was also named Belteshazzar. This thing was true, and it was about a big event in the future. Daniel understood what he saw and what it meant.

2 During that time, I, Daniel, was sad for three whole weeks.

3 I didn't eat any good-tasting bread, and I didn't have any meat or drink any wine. I also didn't put any oil on my skin for the full three weeks.

4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was by the side of the great river, called Hiddekel.

5 I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen with a belt of pure gold around his waist.

6 His body was like shiny green stone, his face shone like lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and legs glowed like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like a big crowd.

7 I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision. The men with me didn't see it, but they were so scared that they ran away to hide.

8 So I was alone and saw this amazing sight, and I had no strength left: for my good looks had faded away, and I kept no strength.

9 I heard his voice speaking, and when I heard it, I was deeply asleep with my face down to the ground.

10 I felt a hand touch me, which made me get on my knees and hands.

11 He said to me, "Daniel, you are deeply loved, understand the words I'm speaking to you, and stand up, because I've been sent to you." After he said this to me, I stood up, shaking.

12 He then told me, "Don't be afraid, Daniel. Because from the first day you decided to understand and humble yourself before God, your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words."

13 The leader of Persia's kingdom resisted me for twenty-one days. But then Michael, a main leader, came to help me, and I stayed there with the Persian kings.

14 I have come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the future: the vision is still for a time far away.

15 After he said those things to me, I looked down and couldn't speak.

16 Look, someone who looked like a human touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke to the one standing in front of me, "Oh sir, because of the vision, I am filled with pain and I have no strength left."

17 How can I, a servant, speak with you, my lord? I am completely weak and have no breath left in me.

18 Then someone who looked like a man came and touched me, giving me strength.

19 He said, "You are very loved, don't be afraid; have peace, be brave, yes, be strong." When he spoke to me, I felt stronger and said, "Please speak, for you have made me strong."

20 He asked, "Do you know why I have come to you? I will now go back to fight against the prince of Persia. And after I leave, the prince of Greece will come."

21 I will show you what is written in the book of truth: no one supports me against them except for Michael, your leader.
