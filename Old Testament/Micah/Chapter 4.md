1 In the future, God's house on the mountain will be the most important, higher than all other hills, and people will come to it.

2 Many nations will come and say, "Let's go up to God's mountain, to the house of Jacob's God; He will teach us His ways, and we will follow His paths. For teachings will come from Zion, and God's word from Jerusalem."

3 He will judge among many peoples and correct powerful nations from far away; they will turn their swords into tools for farming, and their spears into tools for cutting branches. No country will fight against another, nor will they learn war anymore.

4 Everyone will sit under their own vine and fig tree without fear because God has promised it.

5 Everyone will follow their own god, and we will follow our God forever.

6 On that day, God says, I will bring together those who limp, and I will collect those who have been scattered, and those whom I have hurt.

7 I will make those who limp a small surviving group, and those who were sent away a powerful nation: and God will rule over them on Mount Zion from now on, forever.

8 And you, tower of the sheep, the daughter of Zion's stronghold, power will come to you first; the kingdom will come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

9 Why are you crying out loud? Is there no king within you? Has your advisor died? For pains have gripped you like a woman in labor.

10 Feel pain and work hard to give birth, daughter of Zion, like a woman in childbirth: for now you will leave the city, you will live in the fields, and you will go all the way to Babylon; there you will be rescued; there God will save you from your enemies.

11 Now many countries are against you, saying, "Let her become dirty, and let us see Zion."

12 But they do not know God's thoughts or understand his plan: for he will gather them like bundles of grain on the threshing floor.

13 Get up and crush, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your strength iron, and I will make your feet brass, and you will break many people into pieces, and I will dedicate their wealth to God, and their possessions to the God of the whole earth.
