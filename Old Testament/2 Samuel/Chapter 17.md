1 Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me pick twelve thousand men and go after David tonight."

2 I will attack him when he is tired and his hands are weak, making him scared. Everyone with him will run away, and I will strike down only the king.

3 I will return all the people to you: it's like everyone has come back because you're looking for one man: this way, everyone will be at peace.

4 Absalom and all the leaders of Israel liked the idea.

5 Then Absalom said, "Call Hushai the Archite too, so we can hear what he has to say."

6 When Hushai arrived, Absalom asked him, "Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we follow it? If not, you tell us what to do."

7 Hushai told Absalom, "The advice Ahithophel has given is not good right now."

8 Hushai said, you know your father and his men are strong, and they are upset like a bear whose cubs are taken in the field; your father is a warrior and won't stay with the people.

9 Look, he's hiding in a pit or another place. And if some of his men fall at first, anyone who hears will say, 'There's a killing among Absalom's followers.'

10 Even the brave person, with a heart like a lion's, will be completely afraid because everyone in Israel knows your father is a strong man, and those with him are courageous.

11 So I suggest you bring together all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, like the countless grains of sand by the sea; and you yourself should go into the battle.

12 We will find him in some place, and we will surprise him like dew falls on the ground: not one of him or his men will remain.

13 Furthermore, if he enters a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will pull it into the river until not even one small stone is left there.

14 Absalom and all the Israelite men said, "Hushai the Archite's advice is better than Ahithophel's advice." This happened because God planned to ruin Ahithophel's good advice, so that He could bring disaster on Absalom.

15 Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, "Ahithophel gave this advice to Absalom and Israel's leaders, and I gave this advice."

16 So now, send a message to David fast. Say to him, "Don't stay tonight in the desert fields, but hurry and cross the river, so that the king and everyone with him aren't caught."

17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at Enrogel because they didn't want to be seen entering the city. A young woman went to tell them, and they went to inform King David.

18 However, a boy saw them and informed Absalom. They both hurried away and reached a man's house in Bahurim, with a well in his yard, which they entered.

19 The woman covered the well's opening with a cloth and scattered crushed grain on it; and no one knew about it.

20 When Absalom's servants went to the woman's house, they asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman told them, "They crossed the water stream." After searching and not finding them, the servants went back to Jerusalem.

21 After they left, they climbed out of the well, went to tell King David, and said, "Get up and cross the river quickly, because Ahithophel has advised this against you."

22 Then David got up, and everyone with him crossed the Jordan River. By dawn, every one of them had crossed over.

23 When Ahithophel realized his advice was ignored, he prepared his donkey, left, went to his home in his city, arranged his affairs, hanged himself, died, and was buried in his father's tomb.

24 David arrived at Mahanaim. Absalom crossed the Jordan River with all the men of Israel.

25 Absalom appointed Amasa as the army's leader in place of Joab. Amasa's father was Ithra, an Israelite, who had been with Abigail, daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.

26 Israel and Absalom set up camp in the land of Gilead.

27 When David got to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim.

28 Brought beds, basins, clay pots, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, and roasted seeds.

29 Honey, butter, sheep, and cow cheese for David and his people to eat because they were hungry, tired, and thirsty in the desert.
