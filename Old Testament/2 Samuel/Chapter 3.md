1 There was a long war between Saul's family and David's family: but David's family became stronger and stronger, while Saul's family became weaker and weaker.

2 David had sons in Hebron. His first son was Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel.

3 David's second son was Chileab, with his wife Abigail who was Nabal the Carmelite's widow, and the third son was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur.

4 The fourth was Adonijah, Haggith's son; the fifth was Shephatiah, Abital's son.

5 David's sixth son, Ithream, was born from his wife Eglah while they were in Hebron.

6 During the war between Saul's family and David's family, Abner became a strong leader for Saul's family.

7 Saul had a partner named Rizpah, Aiah's daughter. Ishbosheth asked Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's partner?"

8 Abner was very angry because of Ishbosheth's words and said, "Am I worth nothing, who has been loyal to Saul your father's family, his brothers, and his friends today, and haven't handed you over to David, yet you blame me today for a problem with this woman?"

9 May God do to Abner, and even more, unless I do to him as God has promised to David.

10 To move the kingdom from Saul's family and to establish David's rule over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.

11 He could not reply to Abner at all, because he was afraid of him.

12 Abner sent people to David to speak for him, asking, "Who owns the land?" He also said, "Make a deal with me, and I will support you to unite all of Israel under you."

13 He said, "Okay, I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing: you cannot see me unless you bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me."

14 David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I married for a hundred Philistine foreskins."

15 Ishbosheth sent for her and took her from her husband, Phaltiel the son of Laish.

16 Her husband followed her, crying as he went to Bahurim. Then Abner told him, "Go back." And he went back.

17 Abner spoke to the leaders of Israel, saying, "You once wanted David to be your king."

18 Go ahead and do it because God has said about David, "Through my servant David, I will rescue my people Israel from the Philistines and all their enemies."

19 Abner also spoke to the people of Benjamin and then went to tell David in Hebron everything that seemed right to Israel and all the Benjaminites.

20 Abner went to see David in Hebron with twenty men. David gave a feast for Abner and his men.

21 Abner told David, "I will get up and go to bring all of Israel to you, the king, so they can join with you. Then you will rule over everything you want." And David let Abner go, and he left peacefully.

22 David's men and Joab returned from chasing a group and brought back a lot of loot, but Abner was not with David in Hebron; David had let him go, and he left peacefully.

23 When Joab and his army arrived, they told Joab, "Abner, Ner's son, came to the king, and the king let him go, and he left peacefully."

24 Then Joab went to the king and asked, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why did you send him away so he's completely gone?"

25 You know Abner, Ner's son, came to trick you, to find out where you go and what you do.

26 When Joab left David, he sent people to get Abner and they brought him back from Sirah's well, but David didn't know about it.

27 After Abner came back to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside in the gate to talk privately and then struck him below the fifth rib, and Abner died for killing Joab's brother Asahel.

28 After David heard this, he said, "I and my kingdom are innocent before God forever concerning the death of Abner, Ner's son."

29 Let the blame fall on Joab and his family; may his family never be without someone who is sick, has a skin disease, needs a cane to walk, dies by the sword, or goes hungry.

30 Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

31 David said to Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and weep for Abner." And King David walked behind the coffin.

32 They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king cried aloud at Abner's grave; all the people also cried.

33 The king mourned for Abner, saying, "Did Abner die like a fool?"

34 Your hands were not tied, nor were your feet chained; like someone falls before evil men, so you fell. And all the people cried for you again.

35 When everyone came to get David to eat before evening, David vowed, "May God deal with me, and even more, if I eat bread or anything else before the sun sets."

36 Everyone saw what happened, and they liked it; just as everything the king did made the people happy.

37 Everyone and all of Israel knew that day that the king did not want to kill Abner, Ner's son.

38 The king told his servants, "Don't you know that today a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel?"

39 Today, even though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. God will pay back those who do evil for their wickedness.
