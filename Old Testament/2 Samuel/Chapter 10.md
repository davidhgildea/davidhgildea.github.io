1 After this, the king of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king in his place.

2 David said, "I will be kind to Hanun, Nahash's son, just as his father was kind to me." David sent his servants to comfort Hanun because of his father's death. David's servants entered the land of the Ammonites.

3 The leaders of the Ammonites said to their king Hanun, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending these men to comfort you? Hasn't David actually sent them to explore the city, spy on it, and destroy it?"

4 So Hanun took David's servants, shaved half of their beards, cut their clothes up to their bottoms, and sent them away.

5 When they shared this with David, he went out to meet them because the men felt very ashamed. The king said, "Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then come back."

6 When the Ammonites realized that David disliked them, they hired twenty thousand Syrian soldiers from Bethrehob and Zoba, a thousand from King Maacah, and twelve thousand from Ishtob.

7 When David found out, he sent Joab and all his strong soldiers.

8 The Ammonites came and prepared for battle at the gate entrance, while the Syrians from Zoba, Rehob, Ishtob, and Maacah stood alone in the field.

9 When Joab realized he was surrounded by the enemy in front and behind, he picked the best soldiers of Israel and arranged them to fight the Syrians.

10 He gave the rest of the people to his brother Abishai to arrange them for battle against the Ammonites.

11 He said, "If the Syrians are too powerful for me, then you must help me. But if the Ammonites are too powerful for you, I will come and help you."

12 Be brave, let's fight for our people and God's cities, and let God do what he thinks is best.

13 Joab and his soldiers moved closer to fight the Syrians, and the Syrians ran away from them.

14 When the Ammonites saw that the Syrians had run away, they also ran from Abishai and went back to their city. Then Joab left the Ammonites and went to Jerusalem.

15 When the Syrians realized they were defeated by Israel, they joined forces.

16 Hadarezer called and gathered the Syrians from across the river, and they went to Helam with their leader Shobach marching in front.

17 When David heard the news, he brought all of Israel together, crossed the Jordan River, and went to Helam. The Syrians lined up to fight against David and battled with him.

18 The Syrians ran away from Israel; David killed 700 of their chariot men, 40,000 on horseback, and struck their leader Shobach, who died there.

19 When all the kings who served Hadarezer saw they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and worked for them. So, the Syrians were afraid to help the people of Ammon again.
