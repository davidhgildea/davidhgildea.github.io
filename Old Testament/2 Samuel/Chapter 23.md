1 These are the final words of David. David, Jesse's son, spoke, the man lifted up, chosen by the God of Jacob, and Israel's beloved song writer, said.

2 God's Spirit spoke through me, and His words were on my tongue.

3 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me: Whoever leads people must be fair, leading with respect for God.

4 He will be like the light of dawn when the sun rises, on a cloudless morning; like fresh grass growing from the ground when the sun shines brightly after rain.

5 Even though my family is not close to God, He has made a lasting agreement with me, well-planned and certain; this is all that saves me and all I want, even though He doesn't make it prosper.

6 The wicked will all be like thorns pushed aside, because they cannot be picked up with hands.

7 Anyone who touches them must be armed with iron and a spear's shaft; they will be completely burned with fire right there.

8 These are the names of David's strong warriors: The leader is the Tachmonite, who sat in the main chair, was Adino the Eznite. He raised his spear and beat eight hundred enemies at once.

9 After him came Eleazar, son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was one of David's three brave warriors. He stood up to the Philistines gathered for battle when the Israelites had retreated.

10 He got up, fought the Philistines until his hand got tired, and his hand stuck to the sword. God gave a great victory that day, and the people followed him just to take things from the defeated.

11 After him came Shammah, Agee the Hararite's son. The Philistines grouped into a force at a field of lentils, but the people ran away from the Philistines.

12 He stood in the middle of the field, defended it, killed the Philistines, and God gave a great victory.

13 Three of the top thirty soldiers went to see David at Adullam cave during harvest time, while the Philistine army camped in Rephaim Valley.

14 David was in a stronghold, and the Philistines' fort was in Bethlehem at that time.

15 David wished and said, "I want someone to bring me water from the Bethlehem well near the gate!"

16 The three strong men fought through the Philistine army, and got water from the Bethlehem well near the gate, and brought it to David. But he wouldn't drink it and instead poured it out to God.

17 He said, "I could never do this, God! Isn't this the blood of the men who risked their lives?" So he refused to drink it. This is what the three brave men did.

18 Abishai, Joab's brother and Zeruiah's son, was the leader of the three. He raised his spear against three hundred and killed them, earning fame among the three.

19 Wasn't he the most respected of the three? So he became their leader, but he did not reach the level of the top three.

20 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada and a brave man from Kabzeel, did many brave things. He killed two strong Moabite warriors and also killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day.

21 He killed an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian carried a spear, but he confronted him with only a stick, took the spear from the Egyptian, and killed him with it.

22 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, did these things and was famous among the three mighty men.

23 He was more respected than the thirty, but he did not reach the level of the top three. David made him the leader of his bodyguards.

24 Asahel, Joab's brother, was one of the thirty; Elhanan, the son of Dodo from Bethlehem.

25 Shammah from Harod, Elika from Harod,

26 Helez from Palti, Ira the son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,

27 Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

28 Zalmon from Ahoah, Maharai from Netophah,

29 Heleb, Baanah's son, from Netophah; Ittai, Ribai's son, from Gibeah in Benjamin.

30 Benaiah from Pirathon, Hiddai from the Gaash valleys,

31 Abialbon from Arbath, Azmaveth from Barhum,

32 Eliahba from Shaalbim, a son of Jashen, Jonathan,

33 Shammah from Harar, Ahiam, son of Sharar from Harar,

34 Eliphelet, Ahasbai's son, from Maachah, and Eliam, Ahithophel's son, from Gilo.

35 Hezrai from Carmel, Paarai from Arab.

36 Igal, Nathan's son from Zobah, and Bani from Gad,
