1 When the king was in his house, and God had given him peace from all his enemies;

2 The king said to the prophet Nathan, "Look, I live in a cedar house, but God's ark stays in a tent."

3 Nathan told the king, "Go ahead and do everything you want to do because God is with you."

4 That night, God's message came to Nathan, saying,

5 Go and tell my servant David, God says, Will you build me a house to live in?

6 Since I led the people of Israel out of Egypt, I have never lived in a house. Instead, I have moved in a tent and in a shelter.

7 In every place where I have been with all of Israel's children, did I ever ask any tribe I told to take care of my people Israel, "Why don't you build me a cedar house?"

8 So now, tell my servant David this: God says, 'I chose you from the pasture and from tending the sheep to be the leader of my people, Israel.'

9 I was with you wherever you went, and I defeated all your enemies, making your name as great as the most famous people on earth.

10 I will provide a home for my people Israel and settle them so they can live in their own place without moving again; evil people will not trouble them anymore, like in the past.

11 Ever since I appointed leaders for my people Israel and gave you peace from all your enemies, God has promised to build you a house.

12 When your time comes to an end and you die, I will raise up your descendants to follow you, one who will come from your own body, and I will make his kingdom strong.

13 He will build a house for my name, and I will establish his kingdom's throne forever.

14 I will be his father, and he will be my son. If he does wrong, I will correct him with punishment from people and their whippings.

15 My kindness will not leave him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed before you.

16 Your family and kingdom will last forever; your rule will go on forever.

17 Nathan told David everything he had heard and seen.

18 Then King David went in, sat before God, and said, "Who am I, God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?"

19 This was still a small thing to you, God, but you also promised good things for your servant's family far into the future. Is this how people normally act, God?

20 What more can David say to you? You, God, know your servant.

21 For the sake of your promise and your own desire, you have done all these amazing things so that your servant could understand them.

22 You are great, God, because there is no one like you, and there is no other God, just as we have heard.

23 What other nation on earth is like your people Israel? God chose them to be his own, to make himself known, and to perform great and awe-inspiring acts for themâ€”clearing out nations and their gods to free Israel from Egypt.

24 You have made the people of Israel your own people forever, and you, God, have become their God.

25 Now, God, make true your promise about your servant and his family forever, and do as you have promised.

26 May your name be honored always, as people say, "God rules over Israel," and may David's family remain strong in your presence.

27 You, God of all and God of Israel, have told your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has decided to pray this prayer to you.

28 And now, God, you are that God, your words are true, and you have promised this goodness to your servant.

29 Please bless your servant's house so it can last forever in your presence. You, God, have promised this; may your blessing make your servant's house forever blessed.
