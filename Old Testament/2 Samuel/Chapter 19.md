1 Someone told Joab, "Look, the king is crying and grieving for Absalom."

2 That day, the people's victory changed to sadness because they heard that the king was greatly saddened about his son.

3 That day, the people sneaked into the city like those who, feeling ashamed, quietly escape during a fight.

4 The king covered his face and cried out loudly, "My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!"

5 Joab went to the king's house and said, "Today you have embarrassed all your servants who have saved your life, your sons' and daughters' lives, your wives' lives, and your concubines' lives."

6 Because you love your enemies and hate your friends, you have shown today that you care for neither leaders nor followers. Today I realize that if Absalom had survived and all of us had died, you would have been happy.

7 Get up now, go out, and talk kindly to your servants, because I promise by God, if you don't go out, no one will stay with you tonight, and this will be worse for you than all the bad things that have happened to you since you were young until now.

8 The king got up and sat at the gate. People told everyone, "Look, the king is sitting at the gate." All the people went to see the king, because the Israelites had all run away to their tents.

9 All the people across Israel's tribes were arguing, saying, "The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines; but now he has run away from the land because of Absalom."

10 Absalom, who we made our leader, has died in battle. So why don't you talk about bringing the king back?

11 King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, telling them, "Talk to the leaders of Judah and ask them, 'Why are you the last ones to bring the king back to his home when all of Israel is talking about it, even at his home?'"

12 You are my brothers, you are my own flesh and bones: so why are you the last to bring back the king?

13 Tell Amasa, aren't you my family, my own flesh and bone? May God deal with me, even worse, if you are not always the army commander instead of Joab.

14 He made all the men of Judah agree as one; they told the king, "Come back, you and all your helpers."

15 The king went back and arrived at the Jordan River. People from Judah went to Gilgal to meet the king and help him cross the Jordan.

16 Shimei, Gera's son from the tribe of Benjamin, who was from Bahurim, hurried and went down with the men of Judah to meet King David.

17 A thousand men from Benjamin were with him, along with Ziba, a servant from Saul's house, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants; they crossed the Jordan River ahead of the king.

18 A ferry boat took the king's family across and did what he wanted. Shimei, Gera's son, bowed before the king when he crossed the Jordan.

19 He said to the king, "Please don't blame me for doing wrong, and don't remember the bad thing I did when you, the king, left Jerusalem. Don't keep it in your mind."

20 I, your servant, know I have sinned. That's why I am the first one from Joseph's family to meet the king today.

21 But Abishai, Zeruiah's son, replied, "Shouldn't Shimei die for cursing God's chosen one?"

22 David said, "What's my business with you, sons of Zeruiah? Why are you causing trouble for me today? Should anyone be killed in Israel today? Don't I know that today I am king over Israel?"

23 So the king told Shimei, "You will not die." And the king promised him that.

24 Mephibosheth, Saul's son, met the king without caring for his feet, cutting his beard, or washing his clothes since the king left until he returned safely.

25 When he arrived in Jerusalem to see the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you come with me, Mephibosheth?"

26 He replied, "My king, my servant tricked me. I planned to saddle a donkey to ride and go to the king, because I am lame."

27 He has lied about me to you, the king, but you, the king, are like an angel of God. So do what you think is right.

28 Everyone in my father's family was as good as dead before you, the king, but you allowed me, your servant, to eat at your table. So, what right do I have to ask anything more from you, the king?

29 The king said to him, "Why do you talk more about your issues? I've decided, you and Ziba will share the land."

30 Mephibosheth told the king, "Yes, let him take everything, since you, the king, have returned home safely."

31 Barzillai from Gilead left Rogelim and crossed the Jordan River with the king to help him get across.

32 Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old, and he had given the king food while he stayed at Mahanaim, because he was a very important man.

33 The king told Barzillai, "Come with me and I will take care of you in Jerusalem."

34 Barzillai asked the king, "How long do I have left to live that I should go with the king to Jerusalem?"

35 I am eighty years old today: and can I tell right from wrong? Can your servant taste what I eat or drink? Can I still hear the voices of singers, both men and women? Why then should I be a burden to you, the king?

36 I will cross the Jordan River with the king for a short distance. Why should the king give me such a reward?

37 Please let me, your servant, go back to die in my city near my parents' graves. But let Chimham go with you, and you can do for him what you think is best.

38 The king said, "Chimham will come with me, and I will be good to him as you wish. Whatever you ask of me, I will do for you."

39 All the people crossed the Jordan River. When the king crossed, he kissed Barzillai and blessed him, then Barzillai went back to his home.

40 Then the king continued to Gilgal, with Chimham going with him; all the people of Judah led the king, and also half the people of Israel.

41 Look, all the men of Israel came to the king and asked him, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, secretly take you, the king, his family, and all of David's men across the Jordan river?"

42 All the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, "The king is related to us, so why are you angry about this? Did we eat at the king's expense, or did he give us any present?"

43 The men of Israel responded to the men of Judah, saying, "We have ten shares in the king and a stronger claim on David than you. So why did you look down on us? Why wasn't our advice considered first in bringing back our king?" But the men of Judah's responses were harsher than those of the men of Israel.
