1 After this, David asked God, "Should I go to one of Judah's cities?" And God told him, "Go." Then David asked, "Which city should I go to?" And God answered, "To Hebron."

2 David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, who was Nabal's wife from Carmel.

3 David took his soldiers and their families to live in the towns near Hebron.

4 The men of Judah came and made David king over Judah. They told David that the men of Jabesh Gilead buried Saul.

5 David sent messengers to the men of Jabeshgilead and said to them, "God bless you for being so kind to your leader Saul by burying him."

6 Now God show you kindness and honesty, and I will also repay you for this kindness because you have done this.

7 So now, make your hands strong and be brave, because your leader Saul has died, and the people of Judah have made me their king.

8 Abner, Ner's son and leader of Saul's army, took Ishbosheth, Saul's son, to Mahanaim.

9 They made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all of Israel.

10 Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty when he started to rule over Israel and ruled for two years. The people of Judah supported David.

11 David ruled as king in Hebron over Judah for seven years and six months.

12 Abner, Ner's son, and Ishbosheth's servants, Saul's son, left Mahanaim for Gibeon.

13 Joab, Zeruiah's son, and David's servants left and met by the pool of Gibeon. They sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the opposite side.

14 Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men get up and show their skills in front of us." Joab replied, "Let them get up."

15 Then twelve men from Benjamin who were with Ishbosheth, Saul's son, stood up and crossed over, along with twelve of David's servants.

16 They each grabbed their companion by the head and stuck their sword into the other's side, and they fell down together. Therefore, that place was named Field of Swords, in Gibeon.

17 There was a very tough fight that day; and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David's men.

18 Zeruiah had three sons there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel could run as fast as a wild deer.

19 Asahel chased Abner without turning either right or left from following him.

20 Then Abner turned around and asked, "Are you Asahel?" And he replied, "Yes, I am."

21 Abner told him, "Move to your right or left, grab one of the soldiers, and take his armor." But Asahel wouldn't stop chasing him.

22 Abner said to Asahel again, "Stop following me. Why should I hit you and knock you down? How could I then face your brother Joab?"

23 Even though he wouldn't move aside, Abner hit him with the back end of the spear below his chest, so the spear went through him; he collapsed there and died. Everyone who arrived where Asahel had fallen and died stopped in their tracks.

24 Joab and Abishai chased after Abner, and the sun set as they reached the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the road through the desert of Gibeon.

25 The descendants of Benjamin joined together behind Abner, forming one group, and stood on a hilltop.

26 Then Abner called out to Joab, "Can't you see that endless fighting will only bring bitterness in the end? How long will it be before you order your men to stop chasing their own brothers?"

27 Joab said, "As sure as God lives, if you hadn't spoken, by morning the people would have all stopped following their leader."

28 Joab sounded a trumpet, and everyone stopped, no longer chasing Israel or fighting.

29 Abner and his men walked all night across the plain, crossed the Jordan River, traveled through Bithron, and arrived at Mahanaim.

30 Joab stopped chasing Abner. When he brought all the people together, David's servants were missing nineteen men, including Asahel.

31 David's men defeated the Benjamin tribe and Abner's soldiers, so 360 men died.

32 They carried Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb in Bethlehem. Joab and his men traveled all night and arrived at Hebron at dawn.
