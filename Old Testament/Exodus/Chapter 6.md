1 Then God told Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: he will let the people go because of my powerful action, and he will force them to leave his land."

2 God spoke to Moses and told him, "I am God."

3 I showed myself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but they did not know me as Jehovah.

4 I have also made a promise to them to give them the land of Canaan, where they traveled as outsiders.

5 I have heard the cries of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians enslave; I remember my promise.

6 Tell the people of Israel, I am God, and I will free you from the Egyptian's heavy work, and I will save you from their slavery, and I will rescue you with a powerful arm and with mighty acts of judgment.

7 I will make you my people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am your God who frees you from the Egyptians' heavy work.

8 I will take you to the land that I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you as your inheritance: I am God.

9 Moses spoke this way to the Israelites, but they didn't listen to him because they were very sad and suffering from harsh slavery.

10 God spoke to Moses and said,

11 Go and talk to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and tell him to let the Israelites leave his country.

12 Moses spoke to God, saying, "Look, the people of Israel haven't listened to me; so how will Pharaoh listen to me, when I speak so poorly?"

13 God spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them instructions for the Israelites and Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

14 These are the leaders of their families: Reuben, Israel's first son, had Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the Reuben families.

15 Simeon's sons were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, whose mother was from Canaan. These are the Simeon families.

16 These are the names of Levi's sons by generation: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.

17 Gershon's sons were Libni and Shimi, for each family group.

18 Kohath's sons were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived for 133 years.

19 Merari's sons were Mahali and Mushi. These were the Levi families by their generations.

20 Amram married his aunt Jochebed; she gave birth to Aaron and Moses: Amram lived 137 years.

21 Izhar's sons were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.

22 Uzziel's sons were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri.

23 Aaron married Elisheba, Amminadab's daughter and Naashon's sister, and they had Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

24 Korah's sons were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the Korahite family groups.

25 Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of Putiel's daughters; she gave birth to Phinehas: they are the leaders of the Levite family heads.

26 These are Aaron and Moses, whom God told, "Lead Israel's people out of Egypt with their groups."

27 These are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to free the people of Israel from Egypt: they are Moses and Aaron.

28 One day when God spoke to Moses in Egypt,

29 God spoke to Moses and said, "I am God; tell the Pharaoh, king of Egypt, everything I tell you."

30 Moses said to God, "Look, I don't speak well, so how will Pharaoh listen to me?"
