1 Do this to make them holy so they can serve me as priests: Take one young bull and two perfect rams.

2 Make bread without yeast, flat cakes mixed with oil, and thin breads spread with oil, all from wheat flour.

3 Put them all in one basket and bring the basket with the young bull and the two male sheep.

4 Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the meeting tent and wash them with water.

5 Take the clothes, and dress Aaron in the tunic, the ephod's robe, the ephod, the chestpiece, and tie the special belt of the ephod around him.

6 You will place the hat on his head, and put the holy crown on the hat.

7 Then you will take the anointing oil, pour it on his head, and anoint him.

8 Bring his sons and put robes on them.

9 Dress Aaron and his sons with belts and hats, and they will always serve as priests. Set apart Aaron and his sons to be priests.

10 Bring a bull to the meeting tent, and Aaron and his sons will place their hands on the bull's head.

11 Kill the bull in front of God, by the entrance of the meeting tent.

12 Take some of the bull's blood and put it on the altar's horns with your finger, then pour the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.

13 You must take all the fat covering the insides, the layer over the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar.

14 Burn the bull's flesh, skin, and waste outside the camp with fire; it is a sin offering.

15 You must also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons will place their hands on the ram's head.

16 Kill the ram, take its blood, and sprinkle it all around the altar.

17 Cut the ram into pieces, wash its insides and legs, and place them with its other pieces and head.

18 You must burn the entire ram on the altar; it is a burnt sacrifice to God, a pleasing aroma, an offering made with fire to God.

19 You will take the other ram; Aaron and his sons will place their hands on the ram's head.

20 Then you must kill the ram, take some of its blood, and put it on the top of Aaron's right ear, on the tops of his sons' right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, on the big toes of their right feet, and sprinkle the blood all around the altar.

21 Take some of the blood on the altar and the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and his sons' clothes with him. They and their clothes will be made holy.

22 You will also take from the ram the fat, the back part, the fat covering the insides, the layer over the liver, the two kidneys with their fat, and the right front leg, because it is a special ram.

23 One loaf of bread, one cake made with oil, and one thin biscuit from the basket of bread without yeast that is in front of God.

24 You will put everything in Aaron's hands and in his sons' hands, and wave them as an offering in front of God.

25 Take them from their hands and burn them on the altar as a burned offering to God for a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to God.

26 Take the chest part of the ram used for Aaron's dedication and wave it as an offering before God; it will be your portion.

27 Set apart the chest part of the waved offering and the upper part of the lifted offering from the ram dedicated to God, for Aaron and his sons.

28 This will always belong to Aaron and his sons as a permanent law: It is a special gift from the Israelites. It will be a special gift from their peace offerings to God.

29 Aaron's holy clothes will belong to his sons after him; they will be anointed and made holy in them.

30 The new priest, who is his son, must wear these clothes for seven days when he goes into the meeting tent to serve in the sacred area.

31 Cook the meat of the dedication ram in a sacred space.

32 Aaron and his sons will eat the meat of the ram and the bread in the basket near the entrance of the meeting tent.

33 They shall eat the offerings used to make atonement that set them apart and make them holy; but no outsider may eat them because they are sacred.

34 If any of the special meat or bread is left until morning, you must burn what is left. Do not eat it because it is sacred.

35 Do exactly as I told you for Aaron and his sons: Make them holy for seven days.

36 Every day you must offer a bull as a sin sacrifice to make amends; cleanse the altar after making amends for it, and anoint it to make it holy.

37 Make the altar holy by performing a cleansing ceremony for seven days; after that, it will be a very holy altar, and anything that touches it will become holy.

38 You must offer two one-year-old lambs on the altar every day regularly.

39 You should offer one lamb in the morning and another lamb in the evening.

40 With each lamb, mix a tenth of an ephah of flour and a quarter of a hin of olive oil; also offer a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering.

41 Offer the second lamb in the evening, and prepare it like the morning grain offering and accompanying drink offering, as a pleasing aroma, a fire sacrifice to God.

42 Keep offering this burnt sacrifice for all your generations at the entrance of the meeting tent before God: that's where I will meet you to talk to you.

43 I will meet with Israel's people there, and my glory will make the tabernacle holy.

44 I will make the meeting tent and the altar holy, and I will also make Aaron and his sons holy, so they can serve me as priests.

45 I will live among the people of Israel and will be their God.

46 They will understand that I am their God, who led them out of Egypt so I can live with them: I am their God.
