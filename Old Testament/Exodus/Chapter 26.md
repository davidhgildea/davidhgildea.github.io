1 Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine linen, blue, purple, and red, and with skilled work of cherubim on them.

2 One curtain should be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide, and all the curtains should be the same size.

3 The five curtains must be joined together, and the other five curtains must also be joined together.

4 Make blue loops along the edge of one curtain at the side where it connects, and do the same on the far edge of the other curtain where it connects to the second one.

5 Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the edge of the second curtain so they can fasten together.

6 Make fifty gold clasps, and join the curtains together with the clasps to form one tent.

7 Make eleven curtains out of goat hair for the tent's covering.

8 One curtain should be thirty units long and four units wide, and all eleven curtains should be the same size.

9 You will connect five curtains on their own, and six curtains on their own, and fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent.

10 Make fifty loops on the edge of the outer curtain in the set, and fifty loops on the edge of the second curtain that connects to it.

11 Make fifty brass clasps, put them in the loops, and fasten the tent together so it becomes one piece.

12 The leftover part of the tent curtains, the half-piece that's left, should cover the back of the dwelling.

13 Add one foot of cloth on each side of the tent's remaining length so it hangs over the sides of the dwelling place to cover it.

14 Make a red-dyed ram skin cover for the tent, and put a badger skin cover over it.

15 Make upright wooden boards for the tent from acacia wood.

16 Each board must be ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.

17 Each board must have two pegs, lined up with each other; do this for all the boards of the shelter.

18 Make twenty boards for the tabernacle on the south side facing south.

19 Make forty silver bases for the twenty planks; put two bases under each plank for its two projections.

20 For the north side of the tent, there will be twenty boards.

21 They had forty silver bases; each board was supported by two bases.

22 Make six boards for the west side of the tent.

23 Make two frames for the corners of the shelter on both sides.

24 They should be joined together at the bottom and joined at the top to one ring. This is how both will be for the two corners.

25 There will be eight boards with their bases of silver, sixteen bases in total; two bases under each board.

26 Make bars from acacia wood; five for the boards on one side of the tent.

27 Use five bars for one side of the tent, and five bars for the other side of the tent, on the tent's west side.

28 The center bar inside the panels will stretch from one end to the other.

29 Cover the boards with gold and make gold rings to hold the bars, then cover the bars with gold too.

30 Set up the tent as you were shown on the mountain.

31 Make a curtain of blue, purple, and red, and finely twisted linen with skilled work, decorated with cherubs.

32 Hang the curtain on four wooden posts covered with gold, with gold hooks, and set them in four silver bases.

33 Hang the curtain under the clasps, so you can place the ark of the covenant behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the holy place from the most holy place.

34 Place the mercy seat on top of the ark of the covenant inside the most holy room.

35 Place the table outside the curtain, and put the lampstand across from the table on the south side of the tent. Place the table on the north side.

36 Make a curtain for the tent door using blue, purple, red, and good quality linen, decorated with embroidery.

37 Make five wooden posts and cover them with gold. Their hooks will be gold, and make five bronze bases for them.
