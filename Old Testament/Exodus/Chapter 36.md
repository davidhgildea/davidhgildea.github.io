1 Bezaleel, Aholiab, and every skilled person whom God gave wisdom and understanding knew how to do all kinds of work for the sanctuary service, just as God had instructed.

2 Moses called Bezaleel, Aholiab, and every skilled person whom God had given wisdom, and everyone who felt moved to come and do the work.

3 They took from Moses all the gifts the Israelites had brought for the sanctuary's service work. And every morning, they also brought voluntary gifts to him.

4 All the skilled people who did the work for the holy place stopped their own tasks and came.

5 They said to Moses, "The people are giving more than needed for the work that God ordered us to do."

6 Moses ordered and they announced in the camp, "No man or woman should make anything more for the sanctuary offering." So the people stopped bringing things.

7 They had enough materials for all the work, and more than needed.

8 Every skilled worker among them who made the tabernacle created ten curtains from fine linen, blue, purple, and red fabric, with artistic designs of cherubs woven into them.

9 One curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide, and all the curtains were the same size.

10 He joined five curtains together and then joined the other five curtains in the same way.

11 He made blue loops on the edge of one curtain by the seam, and did the same on the edge of the other curtain where it joined the second.

12 He made fifty loops on one curtain, and fifty loops on the edge of the second curtain to join them together. The loops connected one curtain to the other.

13 He made fifty gold clasps and used them to attach the curtains together, so they became one tent.

14 He made eleven goat hair curtains to cover the tent that was over the sanctuary.

15 Each curtain was thirty units long and four units wide; all eleven curtains were the same size.

16 He joined five curtains together, and six curtains together.

17 He made fifty loops on the very end of one curtain for joining, and fifty loops on the edge of the second curtain to connect them.

18 He made fifty bronze clasps to connect the tent so it would be one piece.

19 He made a red-dyed ram skin cover for the tent and another cover of badger skins on top.

20 He made upright boards for the tabernacle out of acacia wood.

21 A board was ten units long and one and a half units wide.

22 Each board had two pegs set evenly apart: he did this for all the tabernacle's boards.

23 He made panels for the tent; twenty panels for the south side facing south.

24 He made forty silver bases for the twenty planks; each plank had two bases for its two projections.

25 For the other side of the tent, facing north, he made twenty boards.

26 They had forty silver bases; two bases under one plank, and two bases under another plank.

27 He made six boards for the west side of the tabernacle.

28 He made two boards for the corners of the tent on both sides.

29 They were joined at the bottom and connected at the top to one ring. This was done for both of them at the two corners.

30 There were eight boards; each had two silver sockets underneath, making sixteen sockets in total.

31 He made poles of acacia wood; five for the panels on one side of the tent.

32 Make five crossbars for the frames on the other side of the tent and five crossbars for the frames at the west end.

33 He made the center bar to go through the boards from one end to the other.

34 He covered the boards with gold, made their rings of gold for the bars, and covered the bars with gold.

35 He made a curtain of blue, purple, and red, and quality linen, skillfully woven with angel designs.

36 He made four pillars of acacia wood for it, covered them with gold, with gold hooks, and made four silver bases for them.

37 He made a curtain for the entrance of the tent with blue, purple, and red colors, and with finely twisted linen, that was sewn.

38 It had five pillars with hooks, and he covered the tops and bands with gold; the five bases were bronze.
