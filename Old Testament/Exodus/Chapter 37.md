1 Bezaleel made the ark from acacia wood: it was 2.5 cubits long, 1.5 cubits wide, and 1.5 cubits high.

2 He covered it with pure gold inside and outside and put a gold border around it.

3 He made four gold rings for it, placing them at its four corners; two rings on one side and two on the other side.

4 He made poles from acacia wood and covered them with gold.

5 He put the poles through the rings on the sides of the chest to carry it.

6 He made the cover out of pure gold; it was three and a half feet long and two and a quarter feet wide.

7 He made two gold cherubs from one piece of gold and put them on both ends of the mercy seat.

8 One angel on one end here, and another angel on the other end there: the angels on both ends were made from the mercy seat.

9 The cherubim spread their wings up high and covered the mercy seat with their wings, facing each other; their faces were toward the mercy seat.

10 He made a table of acacia wood: it was two cubits long, one cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high.

11 He covered it with pure gold and added a gold border around it.

12 He also made a border about a hand's breadth wide around it, and put a gold rim around the border.

13 He made four gold rings and attached them to its four corners on the legs.

14 Next to the edge were the rings, the spots for the poles to carry the table.

15 He made the poles from acacia wood and covered them with gold to carry the table.

16 He made the items for the table—his plates, spoons, cups, and lids to cover them—all out of pure gold.

17 He made the lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand, its base and branches, its cups, buds, and blossoms, were all one piece.

18 The lampstand has six branches coming from its sides; three branches come out from one side, and three branches come out from the other side.

19 Each of the six branches has three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and petals.

20 The candlestick had four cups shaped like almonds, with buds and blossoms.

21 Place a knob under two branches, and do the same for each pair of the six branches coming from the lampstand.

22 Their buds and branches were all one piece; it was all made of pure gold that had been hammered into shape.

23 He made seven lamps, lamp trimmers, and trays out of pure gold.

24 He made it of a talent of pure gold, along with all its utensils.

25 He made the altar for burning incense out of acacia wood. It was one cubit long and one cubit wide, square-shaped, and two cubits high with horns made from the same wood.

26 He covered it with pure gold, the top, the sides all around, and its horns; he also made a gold border around it.

27 He made two gold rings below its molding, at its two corners, on both sides, to hold the poles for carrying it.

28 He made the poles from acacia wood and covered them with gold.

29 He made the sacred oil for anointing and the pure, sweet-smelling incense, as a perfumer would.
