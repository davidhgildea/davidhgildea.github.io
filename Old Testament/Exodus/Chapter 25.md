1 God spoke to Moses and said,

2 Tell the people of Israel to give me an offering. You must accept the offering from anyone who gives it willingly from their heart.

3 Give this as your offering: gold, silver, and bronze.

4 And blue, purple, red, fine cloth, and goat hair.

5 Red-dyed ram skins, badger skins, and acacia wood.

6 Oil for the lamp, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet smelling incense.

7 Onyx stones and stones for setting in the ephod and the breastplate.

8 Let them build a holy place for me, so I can live with them.

9 Follow exactly the design I show you for the tent and for all the equipment, and make them that way.

10 Make an ark from acacia wood: it should be 2.5 cubits long, 1.5 cubits wide, and 1.5 cubits high.

11 Cover it with pure gold inside and out, and put a gold rim around it.

12 Make four gold rings for it and attach them to its four corners; two rings on one side and two on the other side.

13 Make poles from acacia wood and cover them with gold.

14 Put the poles through the rings on the sides of the chest to carry it with them.

15 The poles must remain in the rings of the chest; they must not be removed.

16 Put the laws I give you into the chest.

17 Make a cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.

18 Make two gold cherubs with hammered work at both ends of the cover.

19 Make one angel on one end and another angel on the other end; you should make the angels from the same piece as the mercy seat, at its two ends. 

(Note: "Globish" typically refers to a simplified version of English designed to be understood by non-native speakers around the world, so the term "cherub" has been translated to "angel" for clarity.)

20 The cherubim will spread out their wings above, shielding the mercy seat with their wings, and they will face each other; the cherubim's faces should be toward the mercy seat.

21 Put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and inside the ark, put the laws I will give you.

22 There I will meet with you, and I will talk to you from above the mercy seat, between the two cherubs on the ark of the testimony, about everything I command you for the people of Israel.

23 Also make a table from acacia wood: it should be two cubits long, one cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high.

24 Cover it with pure gold and add a gold border around it.

25 Make a border one hand's width all around it, and put a gold rim around the border.

26 Make four gold rings for it and attach them to its four corners at the four legs.

27 The rings should be right next to the edge to hold the poles that carry the table.

28 Make poles from acacia wood and cover them with gold so the table can be carried with them.

29 Make its plates, spoons, pitchers, and bowls for pouring. Make them all of pure gold.

30 Put bread on the table in front of me always.

31 Make a lampstand of pure gold. It should be crafted from hammered work: its base, arms, cups, buds, and blossoms must all be one piece.

32 Six arms will extend from the sides; three arms of the lampstand from one side, and three arms of the lampstand from the other side.

33 Each of the six branches coming out of the lampstand had three cups shaped like almond flowers, each with buds and petals.

34 In the lampstands there will be four cups shaped like almonds, with their buds and blossoms.

35 There will be a bud below two branches of it, a bud below another two branches, and a bud below two more branches, making six branches coming out of the lampstand.

36 The buds and branches will be one piece with the lampstand, all made from solid gold.

37 Make seven lamps for it, and set up the lamps so they shine light in front of it.

38 Its tongs and snuffdishes must be made of pure gold.

39 He must make it of a talent of pure gold, including all these utensils.

40 Make sure you make them just like the pattern you were shown on the mountain.
