1 Moses and the Israelites sang this song to God, saying, "I will sing to God because he has won a great victory: he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea."

2 God gives me strength and joy; he saves me. He is my God, and I will make a home for him; he's the God of my ancestors, and I will lift him high.

3 God is a warrior; God is his name.

4 God threw Pharaoh's chariots and army into the sea: even his top leaders are drowned in the Red Sea.

5 The waters covered them; they sank deep down like a stone.

6 Your right hand, God, is mighty and wonderful; your right hand, God, has crushed the enemy.

7 In your great excellence, you threw down those who opposed you: you unleashed your anger, which burned them up like dry grass.

8 With your strong breath, the waters piled up, the flowing waters stood still like a mound, and the sea's depths became solid.

9 The enemy said, "I will chase, catch up, and share the goods; I will be fully satisfied with them; I will pull out my sword, and my hand will defeat them."

10 You blew with your wind, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the powerful waters.

11 Who is like you, God, among the gods? Who is as glorious and holy, awesome in praise, doing amazing things?

12 You reached out your right hand, the earth swallowed them up.

13 In your mercy, you have led the people you saved; you have guided them with your strength to your holy home.

14 People will hear and be scared; sadness will grip those living in Palestine.

15 The leaders of Edom will be shocked; the strong people of Moab will shake with fear; everyone in Canaan will lose their courage.

16 They will be very afraid and scared because of your powerful arm; they will be so still like a stone until your people go by, God, until the people you have chosen go by.

17 You will bring them and plant them on your own mountain, the place you made for yourself to live, God, in the sanctuary you have built with your hands.

18 God will rule forever and ever.

19 Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and riders entered the sea, and God made the sea's waters flow back over them; but the Israelites walked on dry ground through the sea.

20 Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, held a tambourine and all the women followed her, playing tambourines and dancing.

21 And Miriam replied, "Sing to God, for He has won a great victory; He has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea."

22 Moses led Israel from the Red Sea into the Shur desert. They traveled for three days without finding water.

23 When they arrived at Marah, they couldn't drink the water because it was bitter. That's why it was named Marah.

24 The people complained to Moses, asking, "What will we drink?"

25 He called out to God, and God showed him a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water became sweet. There he gave them a rule and a law, and there he tested them.

26 If you listen carefully to God's voice and do what is right to him, obey his commands, and follow all his rules, I will not bring any of these diseases on you that I gave to the Egyptians, because I am God who heals you.

27 They arrived at Elim, where there were twelve water wells and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the water.
