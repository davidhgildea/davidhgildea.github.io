1 They made special cloths in blue, purple, and red to serve in the holy area and created holy clothes for Aaron, just as God told Moses.

2 He made the ephod from gold, blue, purple, and red threads, and fine linen.

3 They hammered the gold into thin sheets and sliced it into threads to weave into the blue, purple, and red fabrics, and fine linen with skillful design.

4 They created shoulder parts for it to join it together; it was joined at the two sides.

5 The decorative belt of his vest, made of gold, blue, purple, and red threads and fine linen, was just like the rest of it, as God told Moses.

6 They crafted onyx stones set in gold fittings, engraved like seal rings, with the names of Israel's children.

7 He placed them on the ephod's shoulders to be reminder stones for the Israelites, just as God had instructed Moses.

8 He made the special chest piece with skilled work, like the ephod's work; using gold, blue, purple, and red threads, and quality linen woven tightly.

9 It was square; the chest piece was made double-layered: it was a handspan long and a handspan wide when folded.

10 They placed four rows of stones in it: the first row had a ruby, a topaz, and a garnet; this was the first row.

11 In the second row there was an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

12 The third row had a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

13 The fourth row had a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper, all set in gold frames.

14 The stones matched the names of Israel's children, twelve for each name, carved like a seal with each one's name, for the twelve tribes.

15 They put chains of twisted, pure gold on the chest piece corners.

16 They made two gold clasps and two gold rings; they attached the rings to the two corners of the chest piece.

17 They attached the two twisted gold chains to the two rings on the edges of the chest piece.

18 They attached both ends of the twisted chains to the settings and put them on the shoulder straps of the priestly vest, at the front.

19 They made two gold rings and placed them on the breastplate's two ends, on its edge, next to the ephod inside.

20 They made two more gold rings and placed them on the ephod's sides, near the front, opposite the other set, above the decorative belt.

21 They tied the breastplate to the ephod with blue cord, so it would sit above the ephod's decorative belt and not come loose, just as God told Moses.

22 He made the ephod's robe of woven fabric, all in blue.

23 The robe had a hole in the middle, like the hole in armor, with a band around it so it wouldn't tear.

24 They attached blue, purple, and red pomegranates with twisted linen to the edges of the robe.

25 They made pure gold bells and placed them among the pomegranates on the robe's hem all around.

26 A bell and a fruit, a bell and a fruit, all around the bottom of the robe for serving, just as God told Moses.

27 They made fine linen coats with woven designs for Aaron and his sons.

28 A hat of fine linen, nice caps of fine linen, and linen shorts of fine twisted linen.

29 A belt of fine linen, twisted with blue, purple, and red threads, embroidered as God told Moses.

30 They made the holy crown's plate out of pure gold and engraved on it, like a seal, "Holiness to God."

31 They attached a blue cord to it to tie it to the top of the turban, as God told Moses.

32 All the work for the tabernacle, the meeting tent, was completed. The Israelites followed all the instructions God gave to Moses.

33 They brought the sacred tent to Moses, with all its equipment, its hooks, frames, bars, posts, and bases.

34 The coverings made of red-dyed ram skins, the coverings of sea cow hides, and the curtain of the tent.

35 The box with God's rules, its poles, and the lid with forgiveness.

36 The table, all its dishes, and the bread on display,

37 The clean lampstand and its lamps, the lamps arranged properly, all its tools, and the oil for lighting.

38 The gold altar, the special oil, the sweet-smelling incense, and the curtain for the tent entrance.

39 The bronze altar, its bronze grid, its poles, and all its tools, the washbasin and its base,

40 The curtains of the courtyard, its columns, and bases, the curtain for the gate of the courtyard, its ropes, and stakes, and all the tools used in the service of the meeting tent.

41 The special clothes for serving in the sacred area, the holy outfits for Aaron the priest, and clothes for his sons to serve as priests.

42 Just as God told Moses, the Israelites did all the work.

43 Moses looked at all the work, and saw they had done it just as God had commanded, so he blessed them.
