1 God told Moses, "Leave this place and take the people you brought from Egypt to the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying 'I will give it to your descendants.'"

2 I will send an angel ahead of you; I will push out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

3 To a land filled with plenty and sweetness: because I will not travel with you; you are stubborn people: otherwise I might destroy you on the journey.

4 When the people heard this bad news, they were sad, and no one put on their jewelry.

5 God told Moses to tell the Israelites, "You are stubborn. I will suddenly come to you and punish you. So now, take off your jewelry, and I will decide what to do with you."

6 The Israelites took off their jewelry at Mount Horeb.

7 Moses set up the tent far outside the camp and named it the Meeting Tent. Anyone who wanted to seek God would go to the Meeting Tent, which was outside the camp.

8 When Moses went to the meeting tent, all the people stood up, each at their tent entrance, and watched Moses until he entered the tent.

9 When Moses went into the tent, a cloud came down and stopped at the entrance, and God spoke with Moses.

10 Everyone saw the cloud pillar at the tent entrance, and they all stood up and worshiped at their own tent doors.

11 God spoke to Moses directly, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses went back to the camp, but his helper Joshua, a young man, did not leave the tent.

12 Moses said to God, "Look, you tell me, 'Take these people up,' but you haven't told me who you will send with me. Still, you have said, 'I know your name, and you have found favor with me.'"

13 So now, please, if I have your favor, show me your way so I can know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.

14 He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."

15 He said to him, "If you don't go with us, don't take us from here."

16 How can it be known that I and your people are special to you? Isn't it because you are with us? This is what sets us apart from everyone else in the world.

17 God said to Moses, "I will do what you asked for, because you have gained my favor and I know you by name."

18 He said, "Please, show me your glory, God."

19 He said, "I will let my goodness go by in front of you, and I will say God's name to you; I will be kind to those I choose to be kind to, and I will show mercy on those I decide to show mercy."

20 He said, "You cannot see my face because no one can see me and stay alive."

21 God said, "Look, there is a place near me, and you will stand on a rock."

22 When my glory goes by, I will put you in a gap in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed.

23 I will remove my hand, and you will see my back, but my face will not be seen.
