1 He made the altar for burnt offerings from acacia wood: it was five cubits long and five cubits wide, forming a square, and it was three cubits high.

2 He made horns on its four corners; the horns were part of it, and he covered it with bronze.

3 He made all the altar tools—the pots, shovels, basins, meat hooks, and firepans—all of brass.

4 He made a bronze grate with a mesh design for the altar, to fit under it halfway up.

5 He put four rings on the four corners of the bronze grate to hold the poles.

6 He made the poles out of acacia wood and covered them with bronze.

7 He placed the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it; he built the altar with hollow boards.

8 He made the basin of bronze and its stand of bronze, from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

9 He made the courtyard with fine linen curtains, a hundred cubits long, on the south side.

10 There were twenty pillars and twenty bronze bases; the hooks and bands of the pillars were silver.

11 For the north side, the curtains were 100 cubits long, with 20 pillars and 20 bronze bases; the hooks of the pillars and the bands were silver.

12 For the west side, there were curtains fifty cubits long, with ten posts and ten bases; the hooks of the posts and the bands around them were silver.

13 For the east side, facing east, fifty cubits.

14 The curtains on one side of the entrance were fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.

15 On both sides of the courtyard gate, there were curtains 15 cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.

16 All the curtains surrounding the courtyard were made of fine twisted linen.

17 The bases for the pillars were made of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were made of silver; their capitals were covered with silver; and all the pillars of the courtyard were banded with silver.

18 The curtain for the courtyard gate was made with fine linen and embroidered with blue, purple, and red thread. It was twenty cubits long and five cubits high, just like the other curtains of the courtyard.

19 They had four pillars with four bronze bases, silver hooks, and their capitals and bands were covered with silver.

20 All the hooks for the tent and the surrounding courtyard were made of brass.

21 This is the total of the meeting tent, the tent for witnessing, as it was recorded, as Moses ordered, for the Levites' work, done by Ithamar, Aaron the priest's son.

22 Bezaleel, Uri's son and Hur's grandson from the Judah tribe, made everything that God told Moses to make.

23 Aholiab, son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan, was with him. He was skilled in engraving and craft work, and he embroidered with blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen.

24 All the gold used for the work in the holy place, including the gold given as an offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels, by the sanctuary's weight standard.

25 The congregation's counted silver was one hundred talents and 1,775 shekels, by the sanctuary's standard.

26 Each man must pay half a shekel, using the sanctuary's measure, for the census of everyone 20 years old and above, totaling 603,550 men.

27 From the hundred pieces of silver, the bases for the holy place and the curtain were made; a hundred bases from the hundred pieces of silver, one piece for each base.

28 With 1,775 shekels, he made hooks for the columns, covered their tops, and decorated them.

29 The bronze given as a gift was seventy talents and two thousand four hundred shekels.

30 With it, he made the bases for the entrance of the meeting tent, the bronze altar, its bronze grate, and all the tools for the altar.

31 The bases of the courtyard all around, the bases of the courtyard gate, and all the pegs for the tent, and all the pegs for the courtyard all around.
