1 God told Moses, "I will send one more plague on Pharaoh and Egypt. After that, he will let you leave this place. When he lets you go, he will really force you all out."

2 Tell the people to ask their neighbors, both men and women, for silver and gold jewelry.

3 God made the Egyptians like the people. Also, Moses was very important in Egypt to Pharaoh's officials and the people.

4 Moses said, "God says, 'Around midnight, I will go through Egypt.'"

5 Every first child in Egypt will die, from the Pharaoh's first child on his throne to the servant girl's first child working at the mill; and every first child of the animals too.

6 A terrible scream will spread across Egypt like never before and will never be heard again.

7 No dog will bark at any Israelite, person or animal, so you will see that God treats Israel differently from Egypt.

8 All your servants will come to me and bow down, saying, 'Leave, with all who follow you.' After that, I'll go. And he left Pharaoh, very angry.

9 God told Moses, Pharaoh won't listen to you; this is so I can do many amazing things in Egypt.

10 Moses and Aaron did all these miracles in front of Pharaoh, but God made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, so he wouldn't let the Israelites leave his country.
