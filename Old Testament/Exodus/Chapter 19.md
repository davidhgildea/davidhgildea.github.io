1 In the third month, after Israel's people left Egypt, they arrived in the Sinai desert on that same day.

2 They left Rephidim, came to the Sinai desert, and set up camp in the wilderness; there Israel camped at the mountain.

3 Moses went up to meet God, and God called to him from the mountain, 'This is what you must tell the people of Jacob and say to the Israelites:

4 You saw what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagle's wings, and brought you to me.

5 So now, if you really listen to my voice and keep my agreement, you will be a special treasure for me above everyone because the whole earth is mine.

6 You will be for me a kingdom of priests and a sacred nation. These are the words you must tell the people of Israel.

7 Moses came and gathered the leaders of the people, and told them all the words that God had commanded him.

8 All the people answered at once, saying, "We will do everything God has said." Moses told God what the people said.

9 God said to Moses, "Look, I will come to you in a dense cloud so the people can hear me talking with you and will always trust you." Then Moses reported to God what the people had said.

10 God told Moses, "Go to the people, make them holy today and tomorrow, and have them wash their clothes."

11 Be prepared for the third day because on that day God will come down where everyone can see on Mount Sinai.

12 Set limits for the people all around, and say, 'Be careful not to go up the mountain or touch its edge. Anyone who touches the mountain will certainly be put to death.'

13 No one should touch it, or they must be stoned or shot. Whether animal or person, they must not survive. When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they can go up the mountain.

14 Moses went down from the mountain to the people, made them holy, and they washed their clothes.

15 He told the people, "Get ready for the third day and do not go near your wives."

16 On the third morning, there were thunders and lightning, a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet sound; all the people in the camp shook with fear.

17 Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.

18 Mount Sinai was completely covered in smoke because God came down on it in fire, and the smoke rose like from a furnace, making the whole mountain shake a lot.

19 When the trumpet sound grew long and louder, Moses spoke and God replied with a voice.

20 God came down to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top; and Moses went up.

21 God told Moses, "Go down and warn the people not to force their way through to see God, or many of them will die."

22 Let the priests who approach God make themselves pure, so God doesn't come forcefully upon them.

23 Moses said to God, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai because you told us to put limits around the mountain and make it holy."

24 God told him, "Go down, then come back up with Aaron. But the priests and people must not force their way up to God, or he will punish them."

25 Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.
