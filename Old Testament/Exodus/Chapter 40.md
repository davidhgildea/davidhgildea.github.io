1 God spoke to Moses, saying,

2 On the first day of the first month, you will set up the meeting tent's tabernacle.

3 Place the Ark of the Covenant inside, and hang the curtain in front of the Ark.

4 Bring in the table and arrange the items on it; then bring in the lampstand and light its lamps.

5 Place the gold altar for the incense in front of the ark of the covenant and hang the curtain at the entrance of the tent.

6 Place the altar for burnt offerings in front of the entrance to the tent where people meet with God.

7 Place the basin between the meeting tent and the altar, and fill it with water.

8 You will set up the courtyard all around and put up the curtain at the courtyard entrance.

9 You will take the anointing oil, and anoint the tent of worship, and everything in it, and make it holy, and all its containers: and it will be holy.

10 You will anoint the altar where offerings are burned, along with all its tools, and make the altar holy: it will be a very holy altar.

11 Pour oil on the basin and its stand, and make it holy.

12 Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the meeting tent and wash them with water.

13 Dress Aaron in the holy clothes, anoint him, and make him holy, so he can serve me as a priest.

14 Bring his sons and dress them in robes.

15 You will anoint them just as you anointed their father so they can serve me as priests. Their anointing will be for a priesthood that lasts forever, generation after generation.

16 Moses did everything just as God had commanded him.

17 In the first month of the second year, on the first day, the tabernacle was set up.

18 Moses set up the tent, secured its bases, put up its frames, inserted the crossbars, and raised its posts.

19 He spread out the tent over the holy tent, and placed the tent's covering on top of it, just as God had instructed Moses.

20 He took the testimony, placed it in the chest, attached the poles to the chest, and set the cover on top of the chest.

21 He put the ark in the tent and hung the curtain to cover the ark of the covenant, just as God told Moses to do.

22 He placed the table in the meeting tent, on the north side of the dwelling, outside the curtain.

23 He arranged the bread on it before God, as God had instructed Moses.

24 He placed the lampstand in the meeting tent opposite the table, on the south side of the tent.

25 He lit the lamps before God as God had told Moses to do.

26 He placed the gold altar in the meeting tent in front of the curtain.

27 He burned sweet-smelling incense on it, just as God told Moses.

28 He put up the curtain at the entrance of the tent.

29 He placed the altar for burnt sacrifices near the entrance of the meeting tent's tabernacle and gave burnt and grain offerings on it, just as God told Moses.

30 He placed the basin between the meeting tent and the altar and filled it with water for washing.

31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet there.

32 When they entered the meeting tent, and as they approached the altar, they washed; just as God told Moses.

33 He built the courtyard around the tent and the altar, and put up the curtain for the courtyard entrance. So Moses completed the task.

34 A cloud hid the meeting tent, and God's glory filled the dwelling place.

35 Moses could not go into the meeting tent because the cloud stayed on it, and God's glory filled the holy tent.

36 When the cloud lifted above the tent, the Israelites moved forward on their travels.

37 But if the cloud did not rise, then they did not move until it did.

38 God's cloud was over the tent during the day, and at night, there was fire in all the Israelites' view during their travels.
