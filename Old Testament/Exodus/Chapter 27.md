1 Make an altar from acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar should be square, and its height should be three cubits.

2 Make horns for it on its four corners, and the horns will be made from the same material. Cover it with bronze.

3 Make pans for carrying ashes, shovels, bowls, meat hooks, and firepans, all out of bronze.

4 Make a bronze grid for it, and attach four bronze rings at its corners.

5 Place it under the edge of the altar below, so the net reaches halfway up the altar.

6 Make poles for the altar from acacia wood and cover them with bronze.

7 Put the poles into the rings on the altar's sides to carry it.

8 Make it with boards as a box; just like you were shown on the mountain, that is how they should make it.

9 Make the courtyard of the tent: on the south side, there should be curtains for the courtyard made of finely woven linen, a hundred cubits long for one side.

10 The twenty columns and their twenty bases will be made of bronze; the hooks of the columns and their bands will be made of silver.

11 On the north side, the curtains will be 100 cubits long, with 20 pillars and 20 bronze bases; the hooks and bands of the pillars will be silver.

12 The west side of the courtyard will have curtains that are 50 units long, with ten posts and ten bases.

13 The width of the courtyard on the east side will be fifty cubits.

14 The curtains on one side of the gate will be fifteen units long, with three pillars and three bases.

15 On the other side, there will be curtains fifteen units long, with three posts and three bases.

16 The entrance to the courtyard will have a curtain that is 20 cubits long, made of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen with embroidery. It will have four pillars and four bases.

17 All the poles around the yard must have silver bands; their hooks must be silver, and their bases bronze.

18 The court will be one hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide all around, and five cubits high made of fine linen, with brass bases.

19 All the tools for the tent and everything used in its service, along with all its pegs and all the pegs for the courtyard, must be made of bronze.

20 Tell the people of Israel to bring you pure, crushed olive oil for the lamp so it will keep burning all the time.

21 In the tent where people meet, outside the curtain in front of the rules, Aaron and his sons will take care of it from night to morning before God. It will be a permanent law for them through all their generations for the people of Israel.
