1 He told Moses, "Go up to God, you, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of Israel's elders, and worship from a distance."

2 Only Moses will go close to God; others will not, nor will the people go up with him.

3 Moses told the people everything God said, including the laws. Everyone agreed and said, "We will do everything God has told us."

4 Moses wrote down all of God's words. Early in the morning, he got up, built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and set up twelve stones for the twelve tribes of Israel.

5 He sent young Israelites to present burnt offerings and sacrifice oxen as peace offerings to God.

6 Moses took half of the blood, put it in bowls, and sprinkled the other half on the altar.

7 He took the book of the agreement and read it to the people. They said, "We will do everything God has said and obey."

8 Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, saying, "Look, this is the blood of the agreement God has made with you about all these words."

9 Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders from Israel went up.

10 They saw the God of Israel: under his feet was something like a floor made of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself.

11 God did not harm the leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank.

12 God said to Moses, "Come up to the mountain to me, and stay there. I will give you stone tablets, laws, and commands I have written, so you can teach them."

13 Moses stood up with his helper Joshua and went up the mountain of God.

14 He told the elders, "Stay here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are with you; if anyone has any issues, they should go to them."

15 Moses went up the mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain.

16 God's brightness stayed on Mount Sinai, and a cloud hid it for six days. On the seventh day, He called to Moses from inside the cloud.

17 The children of Israel saw the glory of God as a consuming fire on the mountaintop.

18 Moses went into the cloud and climbed up the mountain, and he was on the mountain for forty days and nights.
