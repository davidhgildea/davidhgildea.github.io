1 Moses took care of his father-in-law Jethro's sheep, who was the priest of Midian. He took the sheep far into the desert and came to God's mountain, called Horeb.

2 An angel of God appeared to him in a fire from inside a bush. He saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up.

3 Moses said, I will go over and look at this amazing thing, why the bush does not burn up.

4 When God saw that Moses came to look, God called to him from the bush, "Moses, Moses!" And he answered, "I'm here."

5 He said, "Don't come any closer. Take off your shoes because the place where you are standing is sacred ground."

6 He also said, "I am your father's God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Moses covered his face because he was scared to look at God.

7 God said, "I have really seen how my people in Egypt are suffering and have heard them cry out because of their harsh bosses; I know their pain."

8 I have come to save them from the Egyptians and to take them from that land to a good and big land, a land filled with milk and honey; to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.

9 So now, look, I've heard the people of Israel's cries, and I've seen how the Egyptians are harshly treating them.

10 Come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh so you can lead my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.

11 Moses said to God, "Who am I to go to Pharaoh and lead the people of Israel out of Egypt?"

12 He said, "I will certainly be with you; and this will be the sign to you that I sent you: When you lead the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain."

13 Moses said to God, "Look, when I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what should I tell them?"

14 God told Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." Then he said, "Tell the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"

15 God also told Moses to say to the Israelites, "The God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and how I am to be remembered for all generations."

16 Go, bring together Israel's leaders, and tell them, God, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me. He said, 'I have carefully watched what has happened to you in Egypt.'

17 I have said I will take you from the suffering in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, to a land filled with milk and honey.

18 They will listen to you. You and Israel's leaders will go to Egypt's king and say, 'The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to our God.'

19 I am certain that the king of Egypt won't let you go, not even with great force.

20 I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all the amazing things I will do there, and then they will let you go.

21 I will make the Egyptians kind to you, and when you leave, you won't leave empty-handed.

22 Every woman will ask her neighbor and any guest in her home for silver and gold jewelry, and clothes. You will dress your sons and daughters in these, taking wealth from the Egyptians.
