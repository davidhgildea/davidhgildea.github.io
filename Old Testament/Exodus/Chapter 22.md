1 If someone steals a cow or a sheep, and kills or sells it, they must give back five cows for a cow, and four sheep for a sheep.

2 If someone catches a thief breaking in and hits him so he dies, no one is guilty of his death.

3 If the sun has risen when he is caught, he must pay for the harm he did. If he can't pay, he will be sold to make up for what he stole.

4 If the stolen animal is found alive with him, whether an ox, a donkey, or a sheep, he must pay back twice as much.

5 If someone lets their animal eat from another person's field or vineyard, they must pay back with the best from their own field or vineyard.

6 If a fire starts and spreads to thorns, burning up piles of grain, standing grain, or fields, the person who started the fire must pay for the damage.

7 If someone gives their neighbor money or items to look after, and they are stolen from the person's house; if the thief is caught, they must pay back twice as much.

8 If the thief is not found, then the homeowner must go to the judges, to find out if he took his neighbor's belongings.

9 For any kind of wrong, whether it's about an ox, a donkey, a sheep, clothing, or any lost item that someone claims as their own, both people involved should go to the judges. Whoever the judges decide is guilty must pay back their neighbor twice as much.

10 If someone gives their neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to take care of, and it dies, gets injured, or is lost without anyone seeing it:

11 Then they both must promise before God that he did not take his neighbor's belongings; the owner must accept this promise, and he will not have to replace them.

12 If someone steals from him, he must pay back the owner.

13 If an animal is torn apart, he must show the pieces as proof and he doesn't have to replace the animal that was killed.

14 If someone borrows something from their neighbor and it gets damaged or dies while the owner is not present, the borrower must definitely replace it.

15 If the owner is with the animal, he doesn't have to pay; if it's a rented animal, the loss is covered by the rental fee.

16 If a man seduces a woman who is not engaged and sleeps with her, he must surely make her his wife by providing a dowry.

17 If her father totally refuses to give her to him, he must pay money as is the custom for a virgin's dowry.

18 Do not let a witch live.

19 Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must be put to death.

20 Anyone who offers sacrifices to any god other than the God alone will be completely destroyed.

21 Do not trouble or be harsh to a foreigner, because you were once foreigners in Egypt.

22 Do not mistreat any widow or orphan.

23 If you hurt them in any way and they call out to me, I will certainly hear their cry.

24 I will become very angry and will kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your children will have no fathers.

25 If you lend money to any of my people who are poor near you, you should not charge them interest.

26 If you take your neighbor's clothes as a promise, you must return them before the sun sets.

27 That is his only blanket, his clothing to cover his skin. What will he sleep in? When he calls to me, I will listen, because I am kind.

28 Do not insult any gods, nor speak ill of your people's leader.

29 Do not wait to give the first of your harvested fruits and drinks; you must give your firstborn sons to me.

30 Treat your oxen and sheep the same way: they must stay with their mother for seven days; on the eighth day, you give them to me.

31 You must be holy for me: do not eat any meat torn by animals in the fields; throw it to the dogs.
