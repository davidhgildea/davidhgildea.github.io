1 Jehoram, Ahab's son, started to rule over Israel in Samaria during Jehoshaphat's eighteenth year as Judah's king, and he ruled for twelve years.

2 He did bad things in God's eyes, but not as much as his father and mother did. He got rid of the Baal statue his father had made.

3 He continued doing the same wrongs as Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin; he did not stop these actions.

4 Mesha, the king of Moab, raised sheep and gave the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and 100,000 rams, along with their wool.

5 After Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.

6 King Jehoram left Samaria then and counted all the people of Israel.

7 He went and sent a message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah: "The king of Moab has revolted against me. Will you join me to fight against Moab?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I will go with you. I am like you, my people are like your people, and my horses like your horses."

8 He asked, "Which way should we go up?" He replied, "The way through the Edom desert."

9 The king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out and traveled for seven days, but there was no water for the army or the animals with them.

10 The king of Israel said, "Oh no! God has brought these three kings together only to let Moab defeat us!"

11 Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of God here so we can ask God for guidance?" And one servant of Israel's king replied, "Elisha, son of Shaphat, who used to help Elijah by pouring water on his hands, is here."

12 Jehoshaphat said, "God's message is with him." So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went to see him.

13 Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do I have to do with you? Go to your father's prophets and your mother's prophets." But the king of Israel replied, "No, because God has brought these three kings together to give them to Moab."

14 Elisha said, "As the living God commands, I serve Him. Truly, if not for my respect for Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not even look at or see you."

15 Now bring me a musician. And when the musician played, God's power came upon him.

16 He said, "God tells us to dig many ditches in this valley."

17 God says, "You won't see wind or rain, but the valley will get filled with water so you and your animals can drink."

18 This is easy for God; He will also give you victory over the Moabites.

19 You must attack every protected city and every valuable city, cut down every good tree, block all the water wells, and cover every good piece of land with stones.

20 In the morning, when the grain offering was made, suddenly water flowed from the direction of Edom, and the land was filled with water.

21 When all the people of Moab heard that the kings had come to battle them, they called together everyone who could wear armor, and older, and they took positions at the border.

22 They got up early in the morning, the sun shined on the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side looking as red as blood.

23 They said, "This is blood: the kings must be killed, and they have attacked each other: now, Moab, let's go take their things."

24 When they reached Israel's camp, the Israelites got up and struck the Moabites, making them run away. But they kept on attacking the Moabites in their own land.

25 They destroyed the cities, threw stones on all the good land, and filled it up; they blocked all the water wells, and cut down the good trees. Only in Kirharaseth did they leave the stones in place; but slingers surrounded it and attacked it.

26 When the king of Moab realized the battle was too tough, he took seven hundred swordsmen to try and get to the king of Edom, but they failed.

27 He sacrificed his oldest son, who was to become king, as a burnt offering on the wall. This act caused great anger towards Israel, making the people leave and go back to their land.
