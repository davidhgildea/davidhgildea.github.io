1 Dead flies make the perfumer's oil give off a bad smell; similarly, a little foolishness can ruin the respect of someone known for wisdom and honor.

2 A wise person's heart leads them to do what is right; but a foolish person's heart leads them to do what is wrong.

3 Yes, when a fool walks on the road, he lacks wisdom, and he tells everyone that he is a fool.

4 If a ruler gets angry with you, don't leave your position; staying calm can resolve major problems.

5 I have seen a bad thing under the sun; it is a mistake that comes from the leader.

6 Foolishness is honored, and the wealthy take the humble seats.

7 I have seen workers on horses and rulers walking like workers on the ground.

8 Anyone who digs a pit will fall into it; and whoever breaks through a hedge, a snake will bite him.

9 Whoever moves stones may get hurt; and whoever splits wood may be in danger from it.

10 If the tool is dull and its sharpness is not honed, then one must use more strength; however, wisdom helps to apply effort effectively.

11 For sure, a snake will bite if it's not charmed; a chatterer is no different.

12 A wise person's words are kind, but a fool's words will ruin him.

13 The first things he says are silly, and his final words are crazy and harmful.

14 A fool talks too much and no one knows what will happen. Who can say what will come after him?

15 The hard work of foolish people tires them all because they don't know how to get to the city.

16 Trouble comes to a country when its leader is immature, and its rulers eat early in the day.

17 Happy is the country when its king is from a noble family, and its leaders eat at the right time, for strength, and not to get drunk.

18 Because of too much laziness, the building falls apart; and because of not using one's hands, the house leaks.

19 A feast is for fun, and wine cheers us up, but money solves all problems.

20 Do not curse the king, even to yourself; and do not curse the wealthy in your bedroom: because a bird might spread the news, and a creature with wings might reveal what you said.
