1 I have seen a bad thing everywhere in the world, and it happens often to people.

2 A man whom God has given money, possessions, and respect, so he lacks nothing he wants, but if God doesn't let him enjoy these things and a stranger does instead, this is pointless and a terrible sickness.

3 If a man has a hundred children and lives a long time, but is not happy or buried when he dies, it is better to be born dead.

4 He comes with emptiness, leaves in the dark, and his name will be shrouded in darkness.

5 He hasn't seen the sun or learned anything; he has more peace than the other.

6 Even if a person lives two thousand years, they still do not experience true happiness. Don't we all end up in the same place after death?

7 Everyone works to feed themselves, but no one is ever fully satisfied.

8 What advantage does a wise person have over a fool? What does the poor person gain by knowing how to conduct themselves in life?

9 Seeing what is in front of you is better than chasing your wishes. This, too, is pointless and frustrating.

10 What has happened has already been named, and it is known that it is human; no one can argue with one who is stronger than themselves.

11 With so many things that add to emptiness, how is a person improved?

12 Who knows what is best for a person in life, during the meaningless days they pass like a shadow? Who can tell anyone what will happen after them under the sun?
