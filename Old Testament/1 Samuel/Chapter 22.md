1 David left that place and went to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's family heard about it, they went down there to be with him.

2 Everyone in trouble, in debt, or unhappy gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.

3 David left and went to Mizpeh in Moab. He said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother stay with you until I find out what God will do for me."

4 He took them to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was hiding.

5 The prophet Gad told David, "Don't stay in the stronghold; leave and go to the land of Judah." So David left and went to the Hareth forest.

6 When Saul found out that David and his men had been located (Saul was staying in Gibeah, sitting under a tree in Ramah, holding his spear, with all his servants standing around him),

7 Saul said to his servants standing near him, "Listen, you from Benjamin’s tribe. Will Jesse’s son give each of you fields and vineyards, and make you leaders over thousands and hundreds?"

8 You all have plotted against me, and no one told me that my son has allied with Jesse's son, and none of you feel sorry for me or informed me that my son has turned my servant against me, to ambush me as of today?

9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's servants, replied, "I saw Jesse's son going to Nob, to meet Ahimelech, Ahitub's son."

10 He asked God for help for him, gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

11 The king sent for Ahimelech the priest, Ahitub's son, and all his family who were priests in Nob, and they all came to the king.

12 Saul said, "Listen, you son of Ahitub." And he replied, "I'm here, my lord."

13 Saul asked, "Why did you plot against me with Jesse's son by giving him bread, a sword, and asking God for help, so he could attack me as he does now?"

14 Ahimelech replied to the king, "And who is as loyal among all your servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, does as you ask, and is respected in your household?"

15 Did I start to ask God for him? No way: let the king not blame me or my family for anything, because I didn't know anything about this at all.

16 The king said, "You will definitely die, Ahimelech, you and your whole family."

17 The king told his guards standing near him, "Turn and kill God's priests because they support David and knew when he escaped but did not tell me." But the king's servants would not raise their hands to attack God's priests.

18 The king told Doeg, "Attack the priests." So Doeg the Edomite attacked the priests and killed eighty-five men wearing linen clothes.

19 He attacked Nob, the city of the priests, and killed with his sword all the men, women, children, babies, cows, donkeys, and sheep.

20 One of Ahimelech's sons, named Abiathar, got away and ran to join David.

21 Abiathar told David that Saul had killed God's priests.

22 David told Abiathar, "I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, he would definitely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of everyone in your father's family."

23 Stay with me, don't be afraid: whoever wants to hurt me wants to hurt you too, but you'll be safe with me.
