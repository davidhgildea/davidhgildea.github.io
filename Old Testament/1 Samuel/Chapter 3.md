1 The boy Samuel served God with Eli. In those times, God's messages were rare and visions were not common.

2 At that time, when Eli was lying down in his spot and his eyes were starting to grow weak so he couldn't see;

3 Before the lamp of God went out in God's temple, where God's ark was, and Samuel had gone to bed;

4 God called Samuel, and he answered, "I'm here."

5 He ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli answered, "I didn't call; go back to bed." So he went and lay down again.

6 God called Samuel again, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, you called me." But he replied, "I didn't call you, my son; go back to sleep."

7 Samuel did not yet know God, and God's word had not been shown to him.

8 God called Samuel a third time. He got up, went to Eli, and said, "I'm here; you called me." Then Eli realized that God had called the boy.

9 So Eli told Samuel, "Go back to bed, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, God; your servant is listening.'" Then Samuel went and lay down in his spot.

10 God came, stood, and called as before, "Samuel, Samuel." Then Samuel answered, "Speak, for your servant is listening."

11 God said to Samuel, "Look, I will do something in Israel that will make everyone's ears who hears it ring."

12 On that day, I will do everything I said about Eli's family: when I start, I will finish it.

13 I have told him that I will always judge his family for the wrongs he knows about; because his sons acted badly, and he did not stop them.

14 So I promised Eli's family that their wrongs will never be forgiven by sacrifice or offering.

15 Samuel lay until morning and opened the doors of God's house. Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.

16 Then Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he replied, "I'm here."

17 He asked, "What did God tell you? Please, don't keep it from me. May God punish you if you hide anything he said from me."

18 Samuel told him everything, and kept nothing from him. And he said, It is God: let him do what seems good to him.

19 Samuel grew up, and God was with him, and made sure that all his words were effective.

20 Everyone in Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, understood that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of God.

21 God appeared again in Shiloh because He showed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh through God's message.
