1 God said to Samuel, "How long will you be sad for Saul, when I have decided he will not be king over Israel? Put oil in your horn and go. I will send you to Jesse of Bethlehem because I have chosen one of his sons to be king."

2 And Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me." And God said, "Take a young cow with you and say, 'I have come to make a sacrifice to God.'"

3 Invite Jesse to the offering, and I will tell you what to do: you shall anoint for me the one I point out to you.

4 Samuel did as God said and went to Bethlehem. The town leaders shook with fear when he arrived and asked, "Do you come in peace?"

5 He said, "I've come to offer a sacrifice to God peacefully. Get ready and join me in the sacrifice." He set Jesse and his sons apart as holy and invited them to the sacrifice.

6 When they arrived, he saw Eliab and thought, "Certainly, God's chosen one is here."

7 But God told Samuel, Do not look at his face or how tall he is, because I have not chosen him. God does not see the way people see; people look at the outside, but God looks at the heart.

8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him walk in front of Samuel. And he said, God has not chosen this one either.

9 Then Jesse had Shammah walk by, but he said, "God has not chosen this one either."

10 Jesse had seven of his sons walk in front of Samuel. Samuel told Jesse, "God has not chosen these."

11 Samuel asked Jesse, "Are all your children here?" Jesse replied, "The youngest is still out, taking care of the sheep." Then Samuel said to Jesse, "Send for him; we won't sit down until he arrives."

12 He sent for him and brought him in. He had red cheeks, a handsome face, and looked good. God said, "Stand up, anoint him; this is the one."

13 Samuel took the oil horn and put oil on David in front of his brothers. God's Spirit came on David from that day on. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah.

14 God's Spirit left Saul, and a bad spirit from God troubled him.

15 Saul's servants told him, "Look, an evil spirit from God is troubling you."

16 Please tell your servants here to find a skilled harp player. When the bad spirit from God comes on you, he can play and you will feel better.

17 Saul told his servants, "Find a man who can play music well and bring him to me."

18 A servant replied, "Look, I've seen Jesse of Bethlehem's son, who is skilled at playing music, a brave strong man, a fighter, smart in decision-making, good-looking, and God is with him."

19 So Saul sent messages to Jesse, saying, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."

20 Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them with his son David to Saul.

21 David went to Saul, stood in front of him, Saul loved him very much, and David became his armor carrier.

22 Saul sent a message to Jesse, saying, "Please let David come and see me, because I like him."

23 When the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David played the harp with his hand, and Saul felt better, and the evil spirit left him.
