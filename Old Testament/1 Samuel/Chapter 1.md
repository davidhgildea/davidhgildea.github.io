1 There was a man from Ramathaim, a town in the Ephraim hills, named Elkanah. He was Jeroham's son, Elihu's grandson, Tohu's great-grandson, and Zuph's great-great-grandson, from the tribe of Ephraim.

2 He had two wives; one was named Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not.

3 This man went to his city every year to worship and offer sacrifices to God in Shiloh. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who were priests of God, were there.

4 When it was time for Elkanah to make an offering, he gave portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.

5 But he gave Hannah a special share because he loved her, even though God had closed her womb.

6 Her enemy upset her a lot to make her worry because God had closed her womb.

7 Every year, when she went to God's house, she upset her. So she cried and didn't eat.

8 Elkanah, her husband, said to her, "Hannah, why are you crying? Why aren't you eating? Why are you so sad? Aren't I more important to you than ten sons?"

9 Hannah stood up after eating in Shiloh and after drinking. Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the temple doorpost of God.

10 She felt deep sadness, prayed to God, and cried hard.

11 She made a promise and said, "God of all, if you truly see my suffering and remember me, and not forget me, but give me a son, then I will dedicate him to God for all his life, and his hair will never be cut."

12 As she kept praying to God, Eli noticed her mouth moving.

13 Hannah was praying silently; her lips moved but no sound came out, so Eli thought she was drunk.

14 Eli asked her, "How long will you stay drunk? Stop drinking wine."

15 Hannah replied, "No, sir, I am a woman with a sad heart. I haven't had wine or strong drink but have told all my troubles to God."

16 Don't consider me a wicked woman, for I have spoken from deep sadness and frustration up to now.

17 Eli answered and said, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel give you what you have asked from Him."

18 She said, "I hope I have been good in your eyes." So the woman left, ate, and was not sad anymore.

19 They got up early in the morning, worshiped God, then went back to their home in Ramah. Elkanah was with his wife Hannah, and God remembered her.

20 So when the time came after Hannah became pregnant, she gave birth to a son and named him Samuel, because she had asked God for him.

21 Elkanah and his family went to give God their yearly sacrifice and to fulfill his promise.

22 But Hannah didn't go; she told her husband, "I won't go until the child is done nursing. Then I'll take him to appear before God, and he will stay there always."

23 Elkanah, her husband, said to her, "Do what you think is best; stay until you have finished breastfeeding him; may God make sure His promise comes true." So the woman stayed and breastfed her son until she stopped.

24 After she stopped breastfeeding him, she brought him along with three young cows, some flour, and a bottle of wine to God's house in Shiloh; the boy was still little.

25 They killed a bull and brought the boy to Eli.

26 And she said, "Oh sir, as you are alive, sir, I am the woman who was standing here with you, praying to God."

27 I prayed for this child, and God has granted what I asked of Him.

28 So I have given him to God; for as long as he lives, he will be given to God. And he worshiped God there.
