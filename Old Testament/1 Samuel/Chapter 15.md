1 Samuel also said to Saul, "God sent me to anoint you as king over his people, over Israel; so now listen to what God says."

2 God says, "I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how he ambushed them on their journey from Egypt."

3 Go and attack Amalek, destroy everything they own, and show no mercy; kill everyone, men and women, babies and children, cows and sheep, camels and donkeys.

4 Saul brought the people together and counted them at Telaim: 200,000 soldiers on foot and 10,000 men from Judah.

5 Saul came to an Amalekite city and hid in the valley.

6 Saul said to the Kenites, "Go away, leave this place away from the Amalekites, so I don't destroy you with them. You were kind to all the Israelites when they left Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.

7 Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, near Egypt.

8 He captured Agag, the king of the Amalekites, alive and killed all the people with the sword.

9 But Saul and the people saved Agag, the best sheep, cows, fat young animals, lambs, and all the good things, and did not completely destroy them; but everything that was bad and worthless, they completely destroyed.

10 God spoke to Samuel, saying,

11 I regret making Saul king because he stopped following me and didn't obey my commands. This made Samuel sad, and he cried out to God all night.

12 When Samuel got up early to see Saul in the morning, someone told Samuel that Saul went to Carmel, made a memorial there, and then moved on and went down to Gilgal.

13 Samuel went to Saul, and Saul told him, "God bless you; I have done what God commanded."

14 Samuel asked, "What is the meaning of the sheep's bleating and the oxen's lowing that I hear?"

15 Saul said, "They got them from the Amalekites because the people kept the best sheep and cattle to offer to God; and we have completely destroyed the rest."

16 Samuel told Saul, "Wait, and I will tell you what God told me tonight." And Saul said to him, "Go ahead."

17 Samuel said, When you thought you were not important, weren't you chosen to lead the tribes of Israel, and didn't God appoint you as king over Israel?

18 God sent you on a mission, telling you, "Go and completely destroy the sinful Amalekites and battle them until they are wiped out."

19 Why didn't you listen to God's voice, but instead took the loot and did wrong in God's eyes?

20 Saul said to Samuel, "Yes, I did what God told me, and I followed the path God gave me. I captured King Agag of Amalek and completely destroyed the Amalekites."

21 But the people took the best of the sheep and cattle, which were supposed to be completely destroyed, to offer as sacrifices to God in Gilgal.

22 And Samuel said, "Does God enjoy burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as listening to God? Look, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen is better than the best parts of rams."

23 Rebellion is like witchcraft, and being stubborn is like doing wrong and worshiping idols. Since you have rejected God's message, He has also rejected you as king.

24 Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned because I broke God's command and your words, since I was afraid of the people and listened to them."

25 Please forgive my sin now, and come back with me so I can worship God.

26 Samuel told Saul, "I will not go back with you because you ignored God's message, and God has decided you won't be king of Israel anymore."

27 As Samuel was leaving, he grabbed the edge of his robe, and it tore.

28 Samuel said to him, "God has taken the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to someone who lives near you, who is better than you."

29 God, the Strength of Israel, will not lie or change His mind, because He is not a human who would need to change His mind.

30 He said, "I have sinned; but please respect me now in front of my people's leaders and Israel, and come back with me so I can worship God."

31 So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped God.

32 Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites." And Agag came to him carefully. And Agag said, "Certainly the worst of death is over."

33 Samuel said, "Just as the sword has left women without children, your mother will be without children among women." And Samuel cut Agag into pieces before God in Gilgal.

34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went to his home in Gibeah.

35 Samuel did not visit Saul again until Saul died. But Samuel felt sad for Saul, and God wished he had not made Saul king over Israel.
