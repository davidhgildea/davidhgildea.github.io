1 David's time to die was near, so he told his son Solomon,

2 I am going the same way everyone on earth goes: so be strong and act like a man.

3 Follow God's instructions, live by his rules, follow his commands, decisions, and teachings as written by Moses, so you may succeed in everything you do and wherever you go.

4 God will keep his promise to me, saying, "If your children pay attention to their behavior and live truthfully with all their heart and soul, you will always have a descendant to rule over Israel."

5 You also know what Joab, son of Zeruiah, did to me and what he did to the two leaders of Israel's armies, to Abner, Ner's son, and to Amasa, Jether's son. He killed them and spilt blood as if at war even though it was peacetime. He stained his belt around his waist and his shoes on his feet with their blood.

6 So use your wisdom and don't let him die peacefully in old age.

7 Show kindness to Barzillai of Gilead's sons and let them eat at your table because they helped me when I ran away from your brother Absalom.

8 Look, you have with you Shimei, son of Gera, from the tribe of Benjamin in Bahurim. He cursed me terribly on the day I went to Mahanaim. But he later met me at the Jordan River, and I promised him in God's name, I would not kill him with the sword.

9 So now, don't consider him innocent: you're a smart man, you know what you should do to him; make sure he goes to his grave covered in blood.

10 David died and was buried in the city of David.

11 David ruled over Israel for forty years: seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.

12 Solomon sat on his father David's throne, and his reign became very strong.

13 Adonijah, Haggith's son, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked, "Do you come in peace?" He replied, "Yes, in peace."

14 He also said, "I have something to tell you." And she replied, "Go ahead."

15 He said, "You know I was supposed to be king, and all Israel looked to me to rule. But now, the kingdom has gone to my brother, because God gave it to him."

16 I am asking you for one favor, please don't refuse me. She said to him, Go ahead.

17 He said, "Please talk to King Solomon (he won't refuse you) and ask him to let me marry Abishag the Shunammite."

18 Bathsheba said, "Okay; I will talk to the king for you."

19 Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk about Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her, sat on his throne, and had a chair placed for his mother; she sat at his right side.

20 She said, "I have one small request; please don't say no to me." And the king answered, "Go ahead, my mother, for I will not refuse you."

21 She said, "Let Abishag from Shunem be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife."

22 King Solomon answered his mother, "Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well ask for the kingdom for him since he's my older brother. And not just for him, but also for Abiathar the priest and Joab, son of Zeruiah.

23 King Solomon swore by God, "May God do the same to me, and even more, if Adonijah hasn't said this and put his own life at risk."

24 So now, because God is alive, who made me king and put me on my father David's throne, and has given me a home as he promised, Adonijah will be killed today.

25 King Solomon sent Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, who attacked and killed him.

26 The king said to Abiathar the priest, "Go to your lands in Anathoth, because you deserve to die. But I won't kill you now because you carried God's ark before my father David and suffered where he suffered."

27 Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest for God; this fulfilled what God had said about Eli's family in Shiloh.

28 News reached Joab because he had supported Adonijah but not Absalom. Joab ran to God's tent and grabbed the corners of the altar.

29 Someone told King Solomon that Joab ran away to God's tent and is now by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, with the order: Go and kill him.

30 Benaiah went to God's tent and told him, "The king says, 'Come out.'" But he replied, "No, I'll die here." Then Benaiah told the king what Joab had said and how he responded.

31 The king said to him, "Do what he told you, attack him and bury him. This will remove the guilt of the innocent blood Joab spilled from me and my father's family."

32 God will make him responsible for the blood he shed. He attacked and killed two men who were more good and fair than himself without my father David knowing it: Abner, Ner's son and leader of Israel's army, and Amasa, Jether's son and leader of Judah's army.

33 Joab and his descendants will always be punished for the bloodshed, but David, his descendants, his family, and his throne will have eternal peace from God.

34 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, went up, attacked him, and killed him. He was buried in his own home in the wilderness.

35 The king placed Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, in charge of the army, and Zadok the priest took Abiathar's position.

36 The king sent for Shimei and told him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, live there, and do not go anywhere else."

37 On the day you leave and cross Kidron Valley, you will know for sure that you will die; your own actions will be the cause.

38 Shimei said to the king, "The words are good: as you, the king, have said, so I, your servant, will do." And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.

39 After three years, two of Shimei's servants escaped to Achish, Maachah's son, the king of Gath. They informed Shimei, "Look, your servants are in Gath."

40 Shimei got up, put a saddle on his donkey, and went to Gath to see Achish to find his servants. Then Shimei went and brought his servants back from Gath.

41 Someone told Solomon that Shimei had left Jerusalem for Gath and had returned.

42 The king summoned Shimei and said to him, "Didn't I make you promise by God and warn you, saying, 'Be sure of this: the day you leave and go anywhere, you will certainly die'? And you said to me, 'What you said is good.'"

43 Why didn't you keep the promise to God and follow the command I gave you?

44 The king also told Shimei, "You know all the wrong you kept secret in your heart that you did to my father David. So, God will make sure your wrongs come back on you."

45 King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will be set up for all time in God's presence.

46 The king told Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to kill him, and he did. So Solomon's rule was made secure.
