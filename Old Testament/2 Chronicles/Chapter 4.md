1 He also made a brass altar, 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 10 cubits high.

2 He also made a large, round basin ten cubits wide from edge to edge and five cubits tall. A cord thirty cubits long could wrap around it.

3 Beneath it there were figures of bulls surrounding it all around: ten per cubit, encircling the basin all around. Two rows of bulls were molded into it when it was made.

4 It rested on twelve oxen, three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east; the sea was placed on top of them, and all their back parts faced inward.

5 Its thickness was as wide as a hand, and its edge was like the edge of a cup decorated with lily flowers; it could contain three thousand baths.

6 He also made ten basins and put five on the right side and five on the left for washing: whatever they needed for the burnt offerings, they washed in the basins; however, the large basin was for the priests to wash in.

7 He made ten gold candlesticks in their shape and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.

8 He also made ten tables and put them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. He made a hundred gold bowls.

9 He also made the courtyard for the priests, a large courtyard, and gates for the courtyard, and he covered the gates with bronze.

10 He placed the sea at the southeast corner.

11 Huram made the pots, shovels, and bowls. Huram completed the work he had to do for King Solomon for God's house.

12 That is, the two pillars, the tops, and the caps on the pillars' tops, and the two networks to cover the two tops of the caps on the pillars.

13 There were 400 pomegranates on the two garlands, with two rows of pomegranates on each garland to cover the two tops of the capitals on the pillars.

14 He also made stands and placed washbasins on the stands.

15 One sea and twelve oxen under it.

16 Huram, his father, made pots, shovels, meat hooks, and all their tools of polished brass for King Solomon for Godâ€™s house.

17 In the Jordan Valley, the king made them, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredathah.

18 Solomon made many of these items, and the brass was so heavy its weight could not be determined.

19 Solomon made all the items for God's house, the gold altar, and the tables for the bread on display.

20 Also, the lampstands with their lamps, to burn as required in front of the inner sanctuary, made of pure gold.

21 He made the flowers, lamps, and tongs out of gold, and it was pure gold.

22 The trimmers, bowls, spoons, and incense burners were all made of pure gold. The entrance to the temple, the inside doors to the most sacred place, and the doors of the main temple were gold.
