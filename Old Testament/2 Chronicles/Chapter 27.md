1 Jotham was 25 years old when he became king, and he ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah, and she was the daughter of Zadok.

2 He did what was right in God's eyes, just like his father Uzziah did, but he didn't go into God's temple. Yet the people still acted wrongly.

3 He built the tall gate for God's house, and on the Ophel wall he built a lot.

4 He also built towns in the hills of Judah, and in the woods he constructed strongholds and towers.

5 He also battled the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. That year, the Ammonites gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amounts in the second and third years too.

6 Jotham grew strong because he lived rightly before God.

7 The other things Jotham did, his wars, and his life are all written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

8 He was twenty-five years old when he started to rule, and he ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem.

9 Jotham died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. Then his son Ahaz became king.
