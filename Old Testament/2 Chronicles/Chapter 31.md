1 After finishing this, all the Israelites there went to the towns of Judah, smashed the idols, cut down the sacred trees, and destroyed the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had completely removed them. Then all the Israelites went back to their own cities and property.

2 Hezekiah organized the priests and Levites by their duties, each person according to their work, for burnt and peace offerings, to serve, give thanks, and praise at the entrance of God's tent.

3 He also set aside part of his own goods for the burn offerings that included the morning and evening ones, as well as those for the sabbaths, new moons, and special festivals, as written in God's law.

4 He also told the people living in Jerusalem to give a share to the priests and Levites, so they would be motivated to follow God's law.

5 As soon as the order spread, the people of Israel gave plenty of their first crops of grain, wine, oil, and honey, and all the field's produce; they also brought a tenth of everything in large amounts.

6 About the people of Israel and Judah living in Judah's cities, they too brought a tenth of their cows and sheep, and a tenth of sacred items set apart for God, and stacked them up.

7 In the third month they started to make the piles, and in the seventh month they finished them.

8 When Hezekiah and the leaders saw the piles, they praised God and His people Israel.

9 Then Hezekiah talked with the priests and the Levites about the piles.

10 Azariah, the main priest from Zadok's family, replied, "Ever since the people started bringing gifts to God's house, we have had more than enough food and plenty left over. God has blessed his people, and the extra we have is this large amount."

11 Hezekiah ordered rooms to be made ready in God's house; and they were prepared.

12 They faithfully brought the offerings, the tithes, and the holy items. Cononiah the Levite was in charge, with his brother Shimei as his assistant.

13 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were supervisors working for Cononiah and his brother Shimei, following orders from King Hezekiah and Azariah, the leader of God's house.

14 Kore, Imnah's son and a Levite gatekeeper from the east, was in charge of the voluntary gifts for God, to hand out God's offerings and the very holy items.

15 Next to him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They were in the towns of the priests, in their assigned duties, giving to their fellow priests in groups, to both the important and the less important.

16 In their list of men, from three years old and up, every one serving at God's house got their daily share of work according to their team's duties.

17 The list included priests by their family lines, and Levites 20 years old and older according to their duties and groups.

18 They listed everyone: their children, wives, sons, and daughters, in the whole community. They dedicated themselves to their special duties with holiness.

19 From Aaron's sons, the priests in the fields outside their cities, each city had men named to give shares to all male priests and to all Levites listed in family records.

20 Hezekiah did good, right, and true things for God in all of Judah.

21 In all the work he started serving God's house, in following the law and commands, he looked for God with all his heart and succeeded.
