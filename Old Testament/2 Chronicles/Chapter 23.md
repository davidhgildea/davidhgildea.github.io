1 In the seventh year, Jehoiada became stronger and made a promise with the leaders of the army: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.

2 They traveled around Judah, collecting Levites from all the towns of Judah, along with the leaders of Israel's families, and they arrived in Jerusalem.

3 The whole group agreed to a promise with the king in God's house. He told them, "Look, the king's son will rule, as God has promised about David's children."

4 This is what you must do: one third of the priests and Levites who start on the Sabbath will guard the doors.

5 One third of the people will be at the king's palace, another third at the Foundation Gate, and everyone else in the courtyards of God's house.

6 Only the priests and the Levite helpers can enter the house of God because they are holy; everyone else must stay outside and guard the house of God.

7 The Levites must surround the king, everyone holding his weapons; and anyone else entering the house must be killed: but stay with the king when he enters and leaves.

8 The Levites and all of Judah did everything priest Jehoiada told them to do, taking their men who were to work on the Sabbath, and those who were to leave, because priest Jehoiada did not change their assignments.

9 Furthermore, the priest Jehoiada gave the commanders spears, small shields, and large shields that used to belong to King David, and were stored in God's house.

10 He placed all the people, each with a weapon in hand, from the right to the left side of the temple, near the altar and temple, around the king.

11 They brought out the king's son, put the crown on him, gave him the law, and declared him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, "May God protect the king."

12 When Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and cheering for the king, she went to where the people were in God's house.

13 She saw that the king was standing by his column at the entrance, with the officials and trumpets near him. Everyone in the land was happy, blowing trumpets, and the musicians with their instruments, and the singing teachers, were praising. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"

14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the army captains and told them, "Take her outside the temple guards: and anyone who follows her should be killed with the sword. Because the priest said, "Do not kill her in God's house."

15 They grabbed her, and when she reached the horse gate near the king's house, they killed her there.

16 Jehoiada made an agreement with himself, all the people, and the king, that they would be God's people.

17 Then all the people went to Baal's temple, tore it down, smashed his altars and statues, and killed Mattan, Baal's priest, by the altars.

18 Jehoiada set up roles in God's house with the priests and Levites David had organized there to present burnt offerings to God according to what is written in Moses' law, with joy and singing, following David's instructions.

19 He placed guards at the doors of God's house so no one unclean could enter.

20 He gathered the leaders, the nobles, the rulers, and everyone from the land, and they took the king from God's house. They went through the main gate to the king's palace and placed the king on his throne.

21 All the people of the land were happy and the city was peaceful after they killed Athaliah with a sword.
