1 King Jehoshaphat of Judah went back to his home in Jerusalem safely.

2 Jehu, son of Hanani, the seer, met him and said to King Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate God? For this, God's anger is on you."

3 Still, good things are in you because you removed the idol worship places from the land and made your heart ready to look for God.

4 Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and he traveled among the people from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim, leading them back to God, the God of their ancestors.

5 He placed judges in the country in all the protected cities of Judah, in each city.

6 He told the judges, "Be careful in what you do, because you are not judging for humans, but for God, who is with you when you make judgments."

7 So now let the fear of God be with you; be careful and do it: because there is no wrong with our God, no favoritism, or acceptance of bribes.

8 In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and Israelite leaders to judge for God and settle disputes when they came back to Jerusalem.

9 He instructed them, "Do this respecting God, faithfully and with a true heart."

10 Whenever your fellow people from the cities come to you with a problem, whether it's about a crime, a law, or rules and decisions, you must warn them not to disobey God, so that they and you will not face God's anger. Do this, and you will not do wrong.

11 Look, Amariah the main priest is in charge of all God's issues; and Zebadiah, Ishmael's son, is the leader for all the king's business: and the Levites will work for you. Act bravely, and God will be with the good.
