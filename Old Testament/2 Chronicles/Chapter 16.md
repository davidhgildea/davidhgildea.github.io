1 In the thirty-sixth year of King Asa's rule, King Baasha of Israel attacked Judah and built Ramah to stop anyone from leaving or entering King Asa's territory.

2 Asa took silver and gold from God's house and the king's palace and sent it to King Benhadad of Syria, who lived in Damascus, with a message.

3 We have an agreement, just like our fathers did. Look, I've sent you silver and gold. Now, end your agreement with Baasha, the king of Israel, so he will leave me alone.

4 Benhadad listened to King Asa and ordered his army leaders to attack Israel's cities; they captured Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim, and all the warehouse cities of Naphtali.

5 When Baasha heard about it, he stopped building Ramah and his work stopped too.

6 King Asa and all the people of Judah removed the stones and wood from Ramah, which Baasha had been using to build, and with them, they built Geba and Mizpah.

7 At that time, Hanani the seer went to Asa, the king of Judah, and told him, "Because you depended on the king of Syria and not on God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped from you."

8 Didn't the Ethiopians and Lubims have a large army with many chariots and horsemen? But because you trusted in God, He gave them over to you.

9 God's eyes move across the whole earth, to show his power to those who are fully committed to him. But you have acted foolishly, and from now on you will face wars.

10 Asa became very angry with the prophet and locked him up because of his anger over this matter. At that time, Asa also treated some of the people harshly.

11 Look, the deeds of Asa, from beginning to end, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

12 In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, Asa became very sick in his feet, and his sickness got very severe. But even in his sickness, he did not ask God for help, only the doctors.

13 Asa died after ruling for forty-one years and was buried with his ancestors.

14 They buried him in his own tomb that he had built for himself in the city of David. They placed him on a bed filled with sweet smells and many spices made by the apothecaries. They had a very big fire for him.
