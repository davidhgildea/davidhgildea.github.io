1 God told me, "Go, show love to a woman loved by her friend but who is unfaithful, just as God loves the people of Israel, even though they turn to other gods and love to drink wine."

2 I bought her for fifteen silver coins, a large amount of barley, and half that amount again.

3 I told her, "You must wait for me for many days; you must not be unfaithful, and you must not belong to another man; and so I will be for you."

4 The Israelites will live for a long time without a king or prince, without sacrifices, statues, special priestly clothes, or household gods.

5 Later, the people of Israel will come back, look for God, and for David their king; they will respect God and his kindness in the future.
