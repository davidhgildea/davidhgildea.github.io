</div>
1 Ephraim chases the wind and follows the east wind: he keeps adding lies and destruction; they make agreements with the Assyrians, and oil is taken to Egypt.

2 God also has an argument with Judah and will punish Jacob for his actions; He will repay him based on what he has done.

3 In the womb, he grabbed his brother's heel, and with his strength, he struggled with God.

4 Yes, he had power over the angel and won; he cried and asked for mercy; he met him in Bethel, where he spoke with us.

5 Even God of all; God is his name to remember.

6 So turn to your God: practice kindness and fairness, and always depend on your God.

7 He is a trader with dishonest scales in his hands; he loves to cheat.

8 Ephraim said, "I have become rich and gained wealth. In all my work, no one will find any wrong that is sin in me."

9 I am God, who brought you out of Egypt, and I will make you live in tents again, like during the festival.

10 I have spoken through the prophets, given many visions, and taught in parables through the prophets' work.

11 Is there wrongdoing in Gilead? Surely they are worthless; they offer bulls in Gilgal; yes, their altars are like piles of stones in the field rows.

12 Jacob ran away to Syria, and Israel worked to marry a wife, and to get a wife he took care of sheep.

13 God led Israel out of Egypt through a prophet, and by a prophet they were kept safe.

14 Ephraim made God very angry, so God will make him face the consequences of his actions, and will make sure his shame remains on him.
