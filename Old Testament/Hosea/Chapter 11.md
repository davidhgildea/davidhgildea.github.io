1 When Israel was young, I loved him and called my son out of Egypt.

2 When they were called, they ignored it; they made sacrifices to false gods and burned incense to idols.

3 I also taught Ephraim to walk, holding them by their arms; yet they did not realize that I healed them.

4 I led them with human ties, with ropes of love. Like one who eases the load on their jaws, I bent down to feed them.

5 He will not go back to Egypt, and the Assyrian will be his king, because they would not come back.

6 The sword will stay in his cities, destroy his branches, and eat them up, because of their own plans.

7 My people love to turn away from me; even when they are called to the Most High, no one praises Him.

8 How can I let you go, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboim? My heart is changed inside me, and my compassion is stirred up.

9 I will not act with fierce anger, nor come back to destroy Ephraim because I am God, not a human; the Holy One among you, and I will not come into the city.

10 They will follow God; He will roar like a lion; when He roars, the children will shake with fear from the west.

11 They will shake with fear like a bird from Egypt and like a dove from Assyria, and I will put them in their homes, says God.

12 Ephraim surrounds me with lies, and Israel with deceit; but Judah still rules with God and is loyal with the holy people.
