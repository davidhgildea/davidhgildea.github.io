1 God's message that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the nations;

2 Against Egypt and Pharaohnecho's army, the king of Egypt, near the Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign, Josiah's son, the king of Judah.

3 Prepare your shields, both large and small, and move forward to fight.

4 Prepare the horses; riders, get ready and put on your helmets; polish the spears and wear your armor.

5 Why have I seen them scared and running away? Their strong ones are defeated, have run quickly, and don't look back because fear was all around, says God.

6 Do not let the fast run away, nor the strong man get away; they will trip and fall by the Euphrates River to the north.

7 Who is this coming up like a flood, with waters swirling like rivers?

8 Egypt rises like a flood, and its waters surge like the rivers. It says, "I will rise and cover the earth. I will destroy the city and its people."

9 Move forward, horses; surge ahead, chariots; and strong warriors step out; the Ethiopians and Libyans with shields; and the Lydians with bows ready.

10 Today is God's day, a day for revenge, so he can fight his enemies. The sword will eat until it is full and drunk with their blood. God has a sacrifice in the land by the Euphrates River.

11 Travel to Gilead and get healing ointment, young woman of Egypt. You will use many treatments in vain; you will not be healed.

12 Countries have heard about your disgrace, and your screams have spread everywhere: because strong people have tripped over each other, and they have both fallen down.

13 God told the prophet Jeremiah how King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon would come and strike the land of Egypt.

14 Tell everyone in Egypt, announce in Migdol, and let Noph and Tahpanhes know: say, "Be strong and get ready; the sword will destroy everything around you."

15 Why were your brave men scattered? They did not stand firm because God drove them away.

16 He caused many to fall, yes, one tumbled onto another; and they said, Get up, let's go back to our own people and the land where we were born, away from the cruel sword.

17 They shouted there, "Pharaoh the king of Egypt is just noise; he missed the scheduled time."

18 I am alive, says the King named God of all. Just like Tabor stands out among the mountains and Carmel at the sea, he will come.

19 You, Egypt's daughter, get ready for captivity: Noph will be ruined and empty without people.

20 Egypt is like a beautiful young cow, but disaster is coming; it is coming from the north.

21 Her paid workers are among her like well-fed bulls; they have turned away and run off together: they did not stay because their disaster came upon them, and their time of punishment.

22 The sound will move like a snake; they will move forward with a military force and attack with axes like woodcutters.

23 They will chop down her forests, says God, even though they are too vast to explore; because they outnumber the grasshoppers and cannot be counted.

24 Egypt's daughter will be ashamed; she will be handed over to the northern people.

25 God, the God of Israel, says, "Look, I will punish the people of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all who trust in him."

26 I will give them over to those who want to kill them, to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and to his officials. Later, it will be lived in again, like in the old times, says God.

27 Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant, and do not be discouraged, Israel. I will save you from far away and your descendants from the land where they are captives. Jacob will come back, be peaceful and secure, and no one will frighten him.

28 Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant, God says: I am with you. I will completely destroy all the nations where I have sent you, but I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you properly, but I will not let you go unpunished.
