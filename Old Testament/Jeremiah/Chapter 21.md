1 God gave a message to Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent Pashur, son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah the priest, to him, saying,

2 Please ask God for us, because King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon is attacking us; maybe God will act for us by his amazing works, so that he might leave us alone.

3 Jeremiah told them, "Tell Zedekiah this:

4 God of Israel says, "Look, I will make your weapons of war that you use to fight the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans surrounding you outside the walls useless, and I will gather them inside this city."

5 I will fight against you with a powerful hand, strong arm, and with anger, fury, and great wrath.

6 I will strike down the people and animals in this city; they will die from a terrible disease.

7 After that, God says, I will hand over Zedekiah, the king of Judah, his officials, and the people who remain in the city, protecting them from disease, war, and hunger, to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, their enemies, and those wanting to kill them. He will strike them down with his sword; he will not hold back, feel sorry, or show mercy.

8 Tell these people, "God says, 'Look, I give you the choice of life and the choice of death.'"

9 Anyone who stays in this city will die from war, hunger, and disease, but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans surrounding you will survive and keep their life safe.

10 I have decided to bring disaster, not good, to this city, says God. It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.

11 Speak about the house of the king of Judah and say, Listen to God's message.

12 Family of David, this is what God says: Judge fairly every morning, and save those who are being robbed by their oppressors; otherwise, my anger will flare up like fire, and burn with no one to put it out, because of your bad actions.

13 Look, I am against you, valley dweller and plain rock, says God; you ask, "Who will attack us? Who will come into our homes?"

14 I will punish you for what you have done, says God, and I will start a fire in your forest, and it will burn everything around it.
