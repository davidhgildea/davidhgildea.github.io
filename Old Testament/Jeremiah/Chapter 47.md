1 God's message came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines before the Pharaoh attacked Gaza.

2 God says, "Look, waters are coming from the north, becoming a flooding river, flooding the land and everything in it; the city and everyone living there. Then people will scream, and everyone in the land will wail."

3 When they hear the loud stomping of his powerful horses, the roar of his chariots, and the rumbling of their wheels, the parents will not turn back to their kids because their hands are too weak.

4 The day is coming to destroy all the Philistines, and to end every remaining helper from Tyre and Sidon: for God will destroy the Philistines, the survivors from the land of Caphtor.

5 Gaza is now bald; Ashkelon and the rest of their valley are destroyed. How long will you hurt yourself?

6 Sword of God, how long until you stop? Go back into your sheath, rest, and be calm.

7 How can it be calm when God has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the coast? That is where he has sent it.
