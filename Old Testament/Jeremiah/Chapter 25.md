1 God's message came to Jeremiah about all the Judah people in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.

2 Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to everyone in Jerusalem, saying,

3 Since the thirteenth year of King Josiah of Judah until now, which is twenty-three years, God has been giving me messages, and I have been telling you them early and often, but you have not listened.

4 God has sent you all his messengers, the prophets, arising early and sending them; but you have not listened or paid attention to hear.

5 They said, "Everyone turn from your bad ways and stop doing wrong, then live in the land that God gave you and your ancestors forever."

6 Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, and do not make me angry with what you do; then I will not harm you.

7 But you have not listened to me, says God; you made me angry with what you have done, which will hurt yourselves.

8 So God Almighty says, "Because you did not listen to my words,"

9 Look, I will send for all the families from the north and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant. I will bring them against this land and its people, as well as all the surrounding nations. I will completely wipe them out, make them shocking to see, a target for hissing, and ruin them forever.

10 I will remove their sounds of joy and happiness, the bridegroom and bride's voices, the noise of the mill, and the candle's light.

11 This entire land will become a wasteland and a shock, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.

12 When seventy years have passed, I will punish the king of Babylon and their nation, says God, for their wrongs, and the land of the Chaldeans will be forever deserted.

13 I will bring all my words that I have spoken against that land to pass, including everything written in this book that Jeremiah has predicted against all the nations.

14 Many nations and powerful kings will use them for their own purposes, and God will repay them based on their actions and the work of their hands.

15 God of Israel told me to take the cup of anger from His hand and make all the countries I send you to, drink from it.

16 They will drink, stagger, and go crazy because of the sword I will send among them.

17 I took the cup from God's hand and made all the nations drink it, to whom God had sent me.

18 This means Jerusalem, the towns in Judah, their kings, and leaders, to turn them into ruins, something shocking, scorned, and cursed, as they are now.

19 Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, his officials, his leaders, and all his citizens;

20 All the mixed people, and all the kings of Uz, and all the kings of the Philistine lands, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remaining people of Ashdod,

21 Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon.

22 All the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the islands across the sea,

23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, and everyone in the farthest places,

24 All the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed people living in the desert,

25 Every king of Zimri, every king of Elam, and every king of the Medes,

26 All the northern kings, from far and close, and every kingdom on earth will drink, and then the king of Sheshach will drink too.

27 Tell them this: God of the armies, the God of Israel, says, "Drink and get drunk, vomit, fall, and don't get up because of the sword I will bring upon you."

28 If they won't take the cup from your hand to drink, then tell them, "God says you will surely drink."

29 Look, I am starting to bring trouble to the city known by my name, and do you think you will go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, because I will send destruction upon all the people of the world, says God.

30 So, speak against them all these words and tell them: God will roar from above and speak from his holy place; he will roar loudly over his home; he will shout like those who crush grapes, against everyone on earth.

31 A sound will be heard across the world; God has a dispute with the countries, he will argue with everyone; he will let the sword kill the wicked, says God.

32 God says, "Look, evil will spread from country to country, and a big storm will come from the edges of the earth."

33 On that day, those God has killed will be scattered from one end of the earth to the other. They won't be mourned or collected or buried; they will be like manure on the soil.

34 Cry out, you leaders of the flock, and weep; roll in the ashes, you important ones, because the time of your defeat and scattering is here; and you will break like a fine vase.

35 The shepherds won't be able to run away, and the leader of the sheep won't be able to escape.

36 Shepherds will cry out, and the leaders of the flock will wail because God has ruined their grazing land.

37 And the peaceful homes are destroyed because of God's intense anger.

38 He has abandoned his hiding place like a lion, because their land is ruined due to the cruel enemy's violence and fierce anger.
