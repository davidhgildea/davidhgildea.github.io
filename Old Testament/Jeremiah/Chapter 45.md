1 Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch, son of Neriah, these words after Baruch wrote them down as Jeremiah said them. This happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's rule, Josiah's son, who was the king of Judah.

2 God, the God of Israel, says this to you, O Baruch:

3 You said, "I am in trouble now! For God has made my sadness greater; I grew weak as I sighed, and I can't find peace."

4 Tell him this: God says, "Look, I will destroy what I have built and uproot what I have planted, all across the land."

5 Are you looking for great things for yourself? Don't look for them, because I will bring trouble to everyone, says God, but I will let you escape with your life wherever you go.
