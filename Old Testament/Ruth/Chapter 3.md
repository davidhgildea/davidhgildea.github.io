1 Then Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, shouldn't I find a peaceful place for you, so you can be happy?"

2 Isn't Boaz, who is related to us, the one whose young women you were with? Look, he is separating the barley on the threshing floor tonight.

3 Clean yourself, then put on perfume and your clothes, and go to the threshing floor. But don't let the man see you until he has finished eating and drinking.

4 When he lies down, notice where he is, then go, uncover his feet, lie down, and he will explain what you should do.

5 She told her, "I will do everything you tell me to do."

6 She went to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to.

7 After Boaz finished eating and drinking, feeling happy, he went to sleep by the pile of grain. Then she quietly approached, uncovered his feet, and lay down.

8 At midnight, the man became scared and turned around, and he saw a woman lying at his feet.

9 He asked, "Who are you?" She replied, "I am Ruth, your servant. Please cover me with your cloak, because you are a close relative."

10 He said, "You are blessed by God, my daughter, because you have shown more kindness now than before. You did not go after young men, whether they were poor or rich."

11 Now, my daughter, do not be afraid; I will do all that you ask, because everyone in my town knows you are a good woman.

12 It is true that I am one of your relatives, but there is another relative closer than me.

13 Stay tonight, and in the morning, if he agrees to help you as a relative should, good; let him help. But if he does not want to help as a relative, then I will help you, as surely as God lives. Rest until morning.

14 She stayed at his feet until morning, and she got up before anyone could recognize each other. And he said, "Don't let anyone know that a woman was here on the threshing floor."

15 He also said, "Bring the veil you're wearing and hold it out." So when she did, he poured six scoops of barley into it and placed it on her back, then she went back to the city.

16 When she went to her mother-in-law, she asked, "Who are you, my daughter?" And she explained everything the man had done to her.

17 She said, "He gave me these six measures of barley and told me, 'Don't go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"

18 She said, "Stay here, my daughter, until you find out what happens. The man won't rest until he sorts it out today."
