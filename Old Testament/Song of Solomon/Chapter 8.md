1 I wish you were like my brother, who nursed at my mother's breasts! If I saw you outside, I would kiss you and no one would look down on me.

2 I would guide you and take you to my mother's home, where she would teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, made from my pomegranates.

3 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should hug me.

4 I tell you, O women of Jerusalem, do not disturb or wake up my love until he wants to.

5 Who is this coming from the desert, leaning on her loved one? I woke you up under the apple tree. There your mother gave birth to you; there she who had you, gave birth.

6 Place me like a seal on your heart, like a seal on your arm; because love is as strong as death; jealousy is as harsh as the tomb: its flames are fiery and intense.

7 No amount of water can put out love, and floods cannot drown it. If someone tried to trade everything in their house for love, it would be totally rejected.

8 We have a young sister, and she doesn't have breasts: what will we do for our sister when someone wants to marry her?

9 If she is a wall, we will build a silver palace on her; if she is a door, we will cover her with cedar planks.

10 I am like a wall, and my breasts are like strong towers: then in his eyes, I was someone who had found favor.

11 Solomon owned a vineyard in Baalhamon; he rented it out to farmers; each was to pay him a thousand silver coins for its produce.

12 My vineyard is mine and it's before me. You, Solomon, get a thousand, and the workers who take care of the fruits get two hundred.

13 You who live in the gardens, your friends listen to your voice: let me hear it too.

14 Hurry, my loved one, and be like a deer or a young stag on the spice-covered hills.
