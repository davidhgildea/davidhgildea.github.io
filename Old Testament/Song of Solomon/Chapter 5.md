1 I have come into my garden, my sister, my partner: I have collected my myrrh and spices; I have eaten my honeycomb and honey; I have drunk my wine and milk. Eat, friends; drink, yes, drink a lot, my loved one.

2 I am asleep, but my heart is awake: it's my loved one's voice knocking, saying, "Let me in, my sister, my love, my pure one, my dove; because my head is wet with dew, and my hair with the dampness of the night."

3 I took off my coat; why should I put it back on? I cleaned my feet; why should I get them dirty again?

4 My loved one reached in through the door opening, and I was deeply stirred for him.

5 I got up to open the door for my loved one; my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with fragrant myrrh, on the lock's handles.

6 I opened the door for my loved one, but he had left and was gone. My heart sank when he spoke. I looked for him but couldn't find him. I called him, but he didn't answer me.

7 The guards patrolling the city found me and beat me; they hurt me. The wall keepers took my veil away.

8 I ask you, women of Jerusalem, if you see my loved one, please tell him I am deeply in love.

9 What makes your beloved better than any other, O most beautiful among women? What makes your beloved stand out that you give us such a command?

10 My loved one is fair and has a healthy red glow, the most outstanding among ten thousand.

11 His head is like the finest gold, his hair is thick and black as a raven.

12 His eyes are like dove's eyes by streams of water, bathed in milk, and perfectly placed.

13 His cheeks are like a garden of sweet spices, and sweet flowers; his lips are like lilies, dripping with the sweet scent of myrrh.

14 His hands are like gold rings with beryl stones; his stomach is like polished ivory decorated with sapphires.

15 His legs are like marble columns on gold bases: his face is like Lebanon, as grand as the cedars.

16 His words are very sweet; yes, he is completely beautiful. This is my loved one, and this is my friend, O women of Jerusalem.
