1 The best song, which is Solomon's.

2 Let him kiss me with his mouth's kisses: because your love is better than wine.

3 Because your perfumes smell so good, your name is like perfume spreading out, so young women love you.

4 Pull me, and we'll run after you. The king brought me into his rooms. We'll be happy and celebrate in you. We will think about your love more than wine. Good people love you.

5 I am dark and beautiful, O women of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like Solomon's drapes.

6 Do not stare at me because I am dark, for the sun has darkened me. My siblings were mad at me; they made me watch over the vineyards, but I did not take care of my own vineyard.

7 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you feed your flock and where you rest them at noon, for why should I be like one who wanders beside the flocks of your friends?

8 If you don't know, most beautiful woman, follow the path where the sheep walked, and feed your young goats near the shepherds' tents.

9 I have compared you, my love, to a group of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.

10 Your cheeks look lovely with rows of jewels, your neck with gold chains.

11 We will create gold borders for you with silver dots.

12 While the king is at his table, my perfume spreads its fragrance.

13 My loved one is like a bundle of myrrh to me; he will rest between my breasts all night.

14 My loved one is to me like a bunch of henna flowers in the vineyards of En Gedi.

15 Look, you are beautiful, my love; look, you are beautiful; your eyes are like doves.

16 Look, you are beautiful, my loved one, yes, delightful; our bed is also fresh and green.

17 The support beams of our house are made of cedar, and the beams of our roof are fir.
