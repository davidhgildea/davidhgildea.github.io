1 Your feet are lovely in sandals, O princess! Your graceful legs are like precious gems, shaped by a skilled artist.

2 Your belly button is like a round cup, always full of drink; your stomach is like a pile of wheat surrounded by lilies.

3 Your two breasts are like two young deer that are twins.

4 Your neck is like a tower made of ivory; your eyes are like fish ponds in Heshbon, near the entrance of Bathrabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon facing Damascus.

5 Your head is like Mount Carmel, and your hair is as purple; the king is captivated by your tresses.

6 You are so beautiful and lovely, O love, with so much joy!

7 Your body is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like bunches of grapes.

8 I said, I will climb the palm tree and grasp its branches. Your breasts will be like bunches of grapes, and your breath will smell like apples.

9 Your mouth is like fine wine for my loved one, smoothly gliding and waking the words of sleepers.

10 I belong to the one I love, and he longs for me.

11 Come, my loved one, let's go out to the field; let's stay overnight in the villages.

12 Let's go early to the vineyards; let's see if the vines have budded, if the grapes are growing, and if the pomegranates are flowering: there I will show you my love.

13 The mandrakes smell sweet, and at our gates there are all kinds of nice fruits, both new and old, that I have saved for you, my dear.
