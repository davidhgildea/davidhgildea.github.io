1 I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys.

2 Like a lily among thorns, so is my loved one among the women.

3 Just like an apple tree stands out from the forest trees, so my loved one stands out among other men. I enjoyed sitting in his shade, and his fruit tasted sweet to me.

4 He took me to a feast, and he showed his love for me like a flag.

5 Support me with raisins, cheer me up with apples; I am overwhelmed with love.

6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand hugs me.

7 I ask you, young women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and deer of the fields, not to disturb or awaken my love until he wishes.

8 I hear my loved one's voice! Look, he's coming, jumping over the mountains, hopping on the hills.

9 My loved one is like a deer or a young stag: look, he stands behind our wall, he looks in at the windows, showing himself through the trellis.

10 My loved one spoke and said to me, Get up, my love, my beautiful one, and come with me.

11 The winter is over, the rain has stopped.

12 Flowers show up on the earth; it's time for birds to sing, and we hear the turtle dove in our land.

13 The fig tree grows its young figs, and the grapevines with new grapes smell sweet. Get up, my love, my beautiful one, and come with me.

14 My dove hiding in the rocks and secret stairways, show me your face, let me hear your voice; your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.

15 Catch the foxes for us, the small foxes that ruin the vineyards; our vineyards are blooming.

16 My loved one belongs to me, and I belong to him; he grazes among the flowers.

17 Wait until the day starts and the shadows vanish, then come back, my loved one, and be like a deer or young stag on the Bether hills.
