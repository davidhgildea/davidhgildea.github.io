1 At night in my bed, I searched for the one my soul loves: I searched for him, but did not find him.

2 I will get up now and walk through the city, in the streets and squares, looking for the one my heart loves. I looked for him but did not find him.

3 The guards walking through the city found me. I asked them, "Have you seen the one I love deeply?"

4 I had just left them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him tightly and wouldn't let go until I brought him to my mother's home, to the room of the one who gave birth to me.

5 I ask you, women of Jerusalem, by the deer and the wild does, do not disturb or wake my love until he wants to.

6 Who is this coming from the desert like smoke columns, scented with myrrh and incense, with all the spice seller's powders?

7 Look at his bed, which belongs to Solomon; sixty brave men surround it, the brave ones of Israel.

8 They all carry swords, skilled in fighting: each man has his sword on his leg because of fear at night.

9 King Solomon built himself a carriage from the wood of Lebanon.

10 He made its pillars of silver, its base of gold, its cover of purple, and its middle was decorated with love, for the women of Jerusalem.

11 Go out, daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon wearing the crown his mother gave him on his wedding day, and on the day he was very happy.
