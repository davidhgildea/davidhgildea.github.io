1 Where has your loved one gone, most beautiful of women? Where did your loved one turn? Let us look for him with you.

2 My loved one has gone to his garden, to the spice beds, to eat in the gardens, and to pick lilies.

3 I belong to my loved one, and my loved one belongs to me; he feeds among the lilies.

4 You are beautiful, my love, like Tirzah, lovely like Jerusalem, awesome like an army with flags.

5 Look away from me, because your eyes overpower me. Your hair is like a group of goats seen on the hills of Gilead.

6 Your teeth are like a flock of clean sheep where each one has twins, and none are without young.

7 Your cheeks behind your hair are like pieces of a pomegranate.

8 There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and countless virgins.

9 My pure dove is one of a kind; she is her mother's only child and the best one she ever had. Other women saw her and praised her; even queens and wives shared their admiration for her.

10 Who is she that appears like the morning, beautiful like the moon, bright like the sun, and awe-inspiring like an army with flags?

11 I went to the nut garden to look at the valley's fruits, and to check if the vine was healthy and the pomegranates were budding.

12 Before I knew it, my desire swept me away like the chariots of Amminadib.

13 Come back, come back, O Shulamite; come back, come back, so we can see you. What will you see in the Shulamite? She is like two armies facing each other.
