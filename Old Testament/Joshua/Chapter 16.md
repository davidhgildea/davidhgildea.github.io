1 Joseph's descendants received land extending from the Jordan at Jericho to the eastern waters of Jericho, reaching to the desert and then to Bethel hill.

2 It goes from Bethel to Luz, and goes through to the edge of Archi to Ataroth.

3 It goes down west to Japhleti's border, to Bethhoron the lower border, and to Gezer; its western end is at the sea.

4 Joseph's sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their share of the land.

5 The territory for the families of Ephraim's descendants was this: their land on the east reached from Atarothaddar to Upper Bethhoron.

6 The border extended toward the sea to Michmethah on the north; it turned east to Taanathshiloh, going past it to Janohah on the east.

7 It went from Janohah to Ataroth and Naarath, reached Jericho, and ended at the Jordan River.

8 The boundary started at Tappuah, went west to the Kanah River, and ended at the sea. This was the land for the families of Ephraim's tribe.

9 The towns set aside for the Ephraim tribe were within the land given to the Manasseh tribe, including all those towns and their surrounding villages.

10 They did not force the Canaanites who lived in Gezer to leave, but the Canaanites still live among the people of Ephraim today, and they have to pay taxes.
