1 When Jabin, the king of Hazor, heard what happened, he sent messages to Jobab, the king of Madon, and to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph.

2 To the kings in the north mountains, the southern plains near Chinneroth, the valley, and near Dor to the west,

3 To the Canaanite in the east and west, the Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Jebusite in the mountains, and Hivite near Hermon in Mizpeh.

4 They left with all their groups, a huge crowd like the sand on the seashore, with many horses and chariots.

5 When all these kings joined forces, they gathered and set up camp at Merom's waters to battle Israel.

6 God told Joshua, "Don't be afraid of them. Tomorrow at this time, I will make sure they are all defeated before Israel. You will disable their horses, and burn their chariots."

7 Joshua and his soldiers surprised them near the waters of Merom and attacked.

8 God gave them to Israel, who struck them and chased them to Great Zidon, Misrephothmaim, and the Valley of Mizpeh in the east; they attacked them until no one was left.

9 Joshua did as God commanded: he crippled their horses and burned their chariots.

10 Joshua then turned back, captured Hazor, and killed its king with a sword; because Hazor used to be the leader of all those kingdoms.

11 They killed everyone there with their swords, completely destroying them; no one was left alive. And he burned Hazor down.

12 Joshua captured all the cities of those kings and defeated them with a sword, destroying them completely, just as Moses, God's servant, had commanded.

13 Israel did not burn any of the strong cities, except for Hazor; only that city did Joshua burn.

14 The people of Israel took all the valuables and animals from these cities for themselves; but they killed every person with their swords until none were left alive.

15 God told Moses what to do, Moses told Joshua, and Joshua did everything God had told Moses.

16 Joshua captured all that land, including the hills, the southern area, the land of Goshen, the valleys, the plains, and Israel's mountains.

17 From Halak mountain, going up to Seir, all the way to Baalgad in Lebanon valley, below Mount Hermon: He captured all their kings, struck them, and killed them.

18 Joshua fought with all those kings for a long time.

19 Every city fought the children of Israel except the Hivites of Gibeon; they captured all others in battle.

20 God made their hearts stubborn so they would fight against Israel, and he could completely destroy them without mercy, just as God told Moses.

21 At that time, Joshua came and removed the Anakim people from the mountains, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the mountains of Judah and Israel. Joshua completely destroyed them along with their cities.

22 No Anakims were left in Israel's land, only some stayed in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.

23 Joshua captured all the land as God told Moses; he gave it to Israel as their tribal inheritance. The land had peace from war.
