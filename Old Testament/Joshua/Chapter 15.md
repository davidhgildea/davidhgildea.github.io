1 This was the tribe of Judah's family land; it reached to Edom's border and Zin desert in the south, which was the farthest part of the southern border.

2 Their southern boundary started at the edge of the Salt Sea, stretching towards the south.

3 It went to the south toward Maalehacrabbim, then to Zin, and up the south to Kadeshbarnea, moved on to Hezron, up to Adar, and turned toward Karkaa.

4 From there it went to Azmon, and ended at the river of Egypt; the southern boundary ended at the sea.

5 The eastern border reached the Salt Sea, up to the end of the Jordan River. And the northern border started at the sea inlet, at the far end of the Jordan.

6 The border rose to Bethhogla, went north of Betharabah, and rose again to the stone of Bohan, Reuben's son.

7 The border went up to Debir from Achor Valley, then north, facing Gilgal, near the ascent to Adummim, on the river's south side. The border reached Enshemesh's waters and ended at Enrogel.

8 The boundary went up through Hinnom Valley to the southern area of the Jebusite city, which is Jerusalem. Then it went up to the mountain peak facing Hinnom Valley to the west, at the end of the Rephaim Valley to the north.

9 The border went from the hilltop to Nephtoah's water spring, then to the towns of Mount Ephron, and reached Baalah, known as Kirjathjearim.

10 The border went from Baalah west to Mount Seir, then ran by the side of Mount Jearim, or Chesalon, to the north, continued down to Bethshemesh, and stretched toward Timnah.

11 The boundary extended to the north side of Ekron, then it went to Shicron, passed by Mount Baalah, and reached Jabneel. The boundary ended at the sea.

12 The western border reached the big sea and its shoreline. This is the surrounding boundary for the families of Judah's descendants.

13 God gave Caleb, Jephunneh's son, a place among Judah's people as God told Joshua, including Hebron, the city of Arba, Anak's father.

14 Caleb forced out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.

15 He went from there to the people of Debir, which used to be called Kirjathsepher.

16 Caleb said, Whoever defeats Kirjathsepher and captures it, I will give him my daughter Achsah as his wife.

17 Othniel, Kenaz's son and Caleb's brother, captured the city, so he was given Achsah, his daughter, as his wife.

18 As she came to him, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey, and Caleb asked her, "What do you want?"

19 She replied, "Please give me a special gift; you have given me land in the south; now also give me water springs." So he gave her the upper and lower springs.

20 This is what the family of the tribe of Judah's descendants will inherit.

21 The farthest towns of Judah's tribe near Edom's southern border were Kabzeel, Eder, and Jagur.

46 From Ekron to the sea, all the area near Ashdod along with its villages.

47 Ashdod with its towns and villages, Gaza with its towns and villages, to the River of Egypt, and the great sea and its border.

48 In the mountains were Shamir, Jattir, and Socoh.

49 And Dannah, and the city of Dannah, which is Debir,

50 Anab, Eshtemoh, and Anim,

51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities and their surrounding villages.

52 Arab, Dumah, and Eshan.

61 In the desert, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

62 Nibshan, Salt City, Engedi; six cities and their villages.

63 The people of Judah couldn't make the Jebusites, who lived in Jerusalem, leave; so the Jebusites live with the people of Judah in Jerusalem until now.
