1 When all the kings near the Jordan River, in the hills, valleys, and along the coast of the great sea next to Lebanon, including the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, heard about it;

2 They came together to fight Joshua and Israel as one.

3 When the people of Gibeon heard about what Joshua did to Jericho and Ai,

4 They acted cleverly, pretending to be messengers, putting old bags on their donkeys, and carrying old, torn, and mended wine skins.

5 They wore old shoes patched up on their feet and old clothes; all their food was dry and moldy.

6 They went to Joshua at the Gilgal camp and said to him and the Israelites, "We come from a distant land: so now, make an agreement with us."

7 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Maybe you live near us; how can we make an agreement with you?"

8 They told Joshua, "We are your servants." And Joshua asked them, "Who are you and where do you come from?"

9 They said to him, "We are your servants from a very distant land. We came because of God's name, for we have heard about his great reputation and everything he did in Egypt."

10 God did many things to the two Amorite kings on the other side of the Jordan River: to Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and to Og, the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.

11 Our leaders and everyone from our land told us, 'Bring food for the trip, go to meet them, and say, "We are your servants; so now, please make an agreement with us."'

12 We brought this bread hot from our homes as food for the journey when we left to meet you; but now, see, it's dry and moldy.

13 We filled these wine bottles when they were new, but look, they are torn now. Our clothes and shoes have gotten old because of our very long trip.

14 The men took some of their food and did not seek advice from God.

15 Joshua made peace with them and agreed to let them live, and the leaders of the people promised them this.

16 Three days after they made a peace agreement, they found out that those people were their neighbors living nearby.

17 The Israelites traveled and reached their cities on the third day. Their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

18 The Israelites did not attack them because their leaders had promised them by God of Israel. But all the people complained against the leaders.

19 All the leaders told the people, "We promised them before God of Israel: so now we cannot harm them."

20 We will do this to them; we will let them live so that we don't get punished, because of the promise we made to them.

21 The leaders told them, "Let them live, but they will cut wood and carry water for the whole community, just as the leaders promised them."

22 Joshua called them and asked, "Why did you trick us into thinking you were far away when you actually live near us?"

23 So now you are cursed, and you will always be slaves, cutting wood and carrying water for the temple of my God.

24 They replied to Joshua, "We were definitely told that your God ordered his servant Moses to give you all the land and to wipe out all the land's people in front of you. So, we were very scared for our lives because of you, and that's why we did this."

25 Now, look, we are in your power: do to us what you think is good and right.

26 He did the same for them and saved them from the Israelites, so they were not killed.

27 On that day, Joshua made them wood cutters and water carriers for the community and God's altar, a job they still do where he chooses.
