1 Joshua was old with many years; and God said to him, "You are old with many years, and there is still a lot of land to take over."

2 This is the land that still remains: all the territory of the Philistines, and all of Geshur.

3 From the River of Egypt to the northern boundary of Ekron, land that is considered Canaanite territory, there are five Philistine rulers: those of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron; and also the people of Avvim.

4 From the south, including all Canaanite territory, and Mearah near the Sidonians, up to Aphek, to the Amorite border:

5 The land of the Giblites and all of Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baalgad at the base of Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.

6 I will make all the people living in the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, including the Sidonians, leave the land so that the Israelites can have it. You should divide this land among the Israelites by drawing lots, just as I told you.

7 Now split this land to give as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

8 The Reubenites and the Gadites got their land on the east side of the Jordan River, which Moses had given them, just as Moses, God's servant, had done.

9 From Aroer, by the Arnon river bank, the city in the river center, and all the flat land from Medeba to Dibon.

10 All the cities ruled by Sihon, the king of the Amorites in Heshbon, up to the territory of the Ammonites.

11 Gilead, the land of the Geshurites and Maachathites, all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan up to Salcah;

12 Moses defeated Og's whole kingdom in Bashan, which included Ashtaroth and Edrei, where the last of the giants lived, and he drove them out.

13 But the Israelites did not force out the Geshurites or the Maachathites. So, the Geshurites and the Maachathites live among the Israelites to this day.

14 God did not give the Levi tribe any land; instead, their inheritance is to receive the burnt sacrifices made to God, just as He promised them.

15 Moses gave the Reuben tribe their land based on their family groups.

16 Their land started at Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon River, including the city in the middle of the river valley, and all the flat land near Medeba.

17 Heshbon and all its towns in the flat area; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon.

18 And Jahaza, Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

19 Kirjathaim, Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mountain valley,

20 Bethpeor, Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

21 All the cities in the flat land and the entire territory of King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses along with Midian's leadersâ€”Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who were rulers under King Sihon and lived in the area.

22 The Israelites also killed Balaam, Beor's son, who was a fortune-teller, with the sword along with the others they had killed.

23 The territory of Reuben's descendants was along the Jordan River. This land was their inheritance, including its towns and villages.

24 Moses gave land to the Gad tribe, to the Gad families.

25 Their border included Jazer, all the towns of Gilead, and half of Ammon's land, reaching to Aroer near Rabbah.

26 From Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the edge of Debir.

27 In the valley there were Betharam, Bethnimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, which were part of King Sihon of Heshbon's realm. This included the land by the Jordan River, up to the shore of the Sea of Chinnereth on the east side of the Jordan.

28 This is what the children of Gad received as their families' inheritance: the cities and their villages.

29 Moses gave land to half of the Manasseh tribe, and this land was owned by the families of that half-tribe.

30 Their border extended from Mahanaim, including all of Bashan, the entire realm of Og, king of Bashan, and all of Jair's settlements in Bashan, sixty cities.

31 Half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of King Og in Bashan, belonged to the descendants of Machir, son of Manasseh, for one group of Machir's family.

32 These are the lands that Moses gave out as inheritance in the Moab plains, across the Jordan River, near Jericho to the east.

33 Moses did not give any land to the tribe of Levi; God was their inheritance, just as he promised them.
