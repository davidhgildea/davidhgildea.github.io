1 When Adonizedec, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured Ai and completely destroyed it, just as he did to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living with them,

2 They were very afraid because Gibeon was a big city like the king's cities, larger than Ai, and all its men were strong.

3 So Adonizedec, the king of Jerusalem, sent a message to Hoham, the king of Hebron; Piram, the king of Jarmuth; Japhia, the king of Lachish; and Debir, the king of Eglon, saying,

4 Come up to me, and help me, so we can defeat Gibeon because it has made peace with Joshua and the people of Israel.

5 So the five Amorite kings – the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon – united their armies and camped at Gibeon to attack it.

6 The men of Gibeon sent a message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, "Don't stop helping your servants; come to us fast, and save us, and help us, because all the Amorite kings who live in the mountains have joined together against us."

7 Joshua went up from Gilgal with all the soldiers and brave warriors.

8 God said to Joshua, "Don't be afraid of them, because I have given them over to you. Not one of them will be able to resist you."

9 Joshua quickly went to them, traveling from Gilgal all night.

10 God confused them before Israel, and killed many at Gibeon, and chased them on the road to Bethhoron, and struck them down to Azekah and Makkedah.

11 As they ran away from Israel, heading toward Bethhoron, God made large stones fall from the sky onto them up to Azekah, and many died. More were killed by the hailstones than by the Israelites' swords.

12 Then Joshua spoke to God when God gave the Amorites to Israel, and he said where Israel could see, "Sun, stop over Gibeon; and Moon, in the valley of Ajalon."

13 The sun stopped, and the moon paused, until the people got revenge on their enemies. Isn't this recorded in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the sky and didn't set for about a full day.

14 There had never been a day like it before or after, when God listened to a human voice, because God fought for Israel.

15 Joshua went back, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.

16 But these five kings ran away and hid in a cave at Makkedah.

17 Someone told Joshua, "The five kings are hiding in a cave at Makkedah."

18 Joshua said, "Put big rocks over the cave entrance and have men guard it."

19 Do not stop, but chase your enemies and strike those at the back; do not let them go into their cities: for God has given them into your control.

20 When Joshua and the Israelites finished killing them until they were all dead, the survivors went to fortified cities.

21 All the people went back to the camp with Joshua at Makkedah safely; no one said anything bad about the Israelites.

22 Joshua said, "Open the cave and bring those five kings out to me."

23 They did that and brought out the five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

24 When they took the kings to Joshua, Joshua told the Israelite men and the captains of the soldiers with him, "Come close, step on these kings' necks." They came close and stepped on their necks.

25 Joshua told them, "Don't be afraid or discouraged. Be strong and brave. This is how God will treat all your enemies you fight against."

26 Afterward, Joshua struck them, killed them, and hung them on five trees, where they stayed until evening.

27 When the sun was setting, Joshua ordered, and they took the bodies down from the trees, threw them into the cave where they had been hidden and put big rocks at the entrance of the cave, which are still there today.

28 On that day Joshua captured Makkedah, defeated it with the sword, and completely destroyed its king, everyone in it; he left no one alive. He treated the king of Makkedah just like he did the king of Jericho.

29 Joshua moved on from Makkedah with all Israel to Libnah and fought against it.

30 God gave the city and its king to Israel; they struck it with the sword, killing everyone there. No one was left alive, just as they did to the king of Jericho.

31 Joshua moved from Libnah with all of Israel to Lachish, set up camp there, and fought against it.

32 God gave Lachish to Israel, and on the second day, they captured it, struck it with the sword, and killed everyone inside, just as they had done to Libnah.

33 Horam, king of Gezer, came to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his people, leaving no survivors.

34 Joshua moved from Lachish to Eglon with all Israel, and they set up camp there and attacked it.

35 On that day, they captured it and struck it with the sword's blade, and he completely destroyed everyone in it, just like he had done to Lachish.

36 Joshua left Eglon with all the Israelites and went to Hebron, where they battled it.

37 They captured it and struck it with the sword's edge, including its king, all its cities, and everyone inside. None were left alive, just as they had done to Eglon. They completely destroyed it and everyone inside.

38 Joshua went back and all Israel with him to Debir, and they fought against it.

39 He took the city, its king, and all its towns. They struck them with the sword and completely destroyed everyone there. He spared no one. Just as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, and also to Libnah and its king.

40 Joshua defeated the entire area of the hills, the south, the valleys, and the springs, along with all their kings. He didn't leave anyone alive but completely wiped out every living thing, just as God of Israel had commanded.

41 Joshua defeated them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza, and all the area of Goshen, up to Gibeon.

42 Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at once, because God was fighting for Israel.

43 Joshua went back, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
