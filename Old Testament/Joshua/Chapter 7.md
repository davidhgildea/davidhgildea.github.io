1 The Israelites did wrong with the cursed item, because Achan, son of Carmi, grandson of Zabdi, great-grandson of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took the cursed item, and God became angry with the Israelites.

2 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, near Bethaven, east of Bethel, and told them, "Go and look at the land." The men went and saw Ai.

3 They went back to Joshua and told him, "Don't send all the people. Just send about two or three thousand men to attack Ai. Don't tire everyone out because Ai has only a few people."

4 About three thousand men from the people went up there, but they ran away from the men of Ai.

5 The men of Ai killed about 36 of them; they pursued them from the city gate to Shebarim and attacked them on the slopes. The people's courage dissolved completely.

6 Joshua tore his clothes, fell to the ground on his face in front of God's ark until evening, along with the leaders of Israel, and they put dust on their heads.

7 And Joshua said, "Oh no, God, why did you bring us across the Jordan River only to let the Amorites defeat us? I wish we had stayed on the other side of the Jordan!"

8 God, what can I say when Israel runs away from their enemies?

9 The Canaanites and everyone living in the land will hear about it, surround us, and wipe out our name from the world: what will you do for your great name then, God?

10 God said to Joshua, "Get up; why are you lying down on your face?"

11 Israel has sinned, and they have broken the agreement I gave them: they have taken cursed things, stolen, lied, and put these things with their own belongings.

12 So, the Israelites couldn't face their enemies and ran away because they were cursed. I won't stay with you unless you get rid of the cursed ones among you.

13 Get up, make the people holy, and say, 'Make yourselves holy for tomorrow because God says, "Israel has something cursed among them. You cannot defeat your enemies until you remove the cursed thing from you."

14 In the morning, you will be brought forward by your tribes. The tribe God chooses will come forward by families. The family God chooses will come forward by households. The household God chooses will come forward one person at a time.

15 Whoever is caught with the cursed item will be burned with fire, along with everything he owns, because he broke God's agreement and did foolish things in Israel.

16 Joshua got up early in the morning, gathered Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was chosen.

17 He brought Judah's family forward; he chose the Zarhite family. He presented the Zarhites one by one, and Zabdi was selected.

18 He brought his family one by one; and Achan, son of Carmi, grandson of Zabdi, great-grandson of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was chosen.

19 Joshua said to Achan, "My son, honor the God of Israel, confess to Him; and tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me."

20 Achan replied to Joshua, "I truly sinned against God of Israel, and this is what I have done:"

21 When I saw a fine Babylonian robe, two hundred pieces of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty pieces among the loot, I wanted them and took them. They are now buried in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.

22 Joshua sent messengers, and they hurried to the tent; there, hidden in his tent, was the object with the silver underneath.

23 They removed them from inside the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before God.

24 Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan, Zerah's son, the silver, the clothes, the gold bar, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything he owned, and they brought them to Achor Valley.

25 Joshua asked, "Why have you brought us trouble? God will bring trouble on you today." Then all of Israel threw stones at them and burned them after they had thrown stones.

26 They put a big pile of stones over him, which is still there today. So God stopped being so angry. That's why they named the place the Valley of Trouble, a name it still has today.
