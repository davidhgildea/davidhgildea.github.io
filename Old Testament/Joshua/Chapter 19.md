1 The second choice was for the tribe of Simeon's descendants, according to their families. Their land was inside the land given to Judah's descendants.

2 They received Beersheba, Sheba, and Moladah as their inheritance.

3 And Hazarshual, Balah, and Azem.

4 Eltolad, Bethul, and Hormah,

5 Ziklag, Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

6 Bethlebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages.

7 Ain, Remmon, Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their surrounding villages.

8 All the small towns near these cities, as far as Baalathbeer and Ramath in the south, were part of the land given to the Simeon tribe's families.

9 The tribe of Simeon received their land from the allotment of the tribe of Judah because Judah's portion was too large for them, so Simeon's inheritance was within Judah's land.

10 The third share was for the families of Zebulun, and their territory reached to Sarid.

11 Their boundary went up to the sea, through Maralah, to Dabbasheth, and to the river near Jokneam.

12 It turned from Sarid to the east, towards the sunrise, to the edge of Chislothtabor, then continued to Daberath, and went up to Japhia.

13 It moves on from there to the east toward Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, then turns toward Remmonmethoar until it reaches Neah.

14 The border goes around it on the north side to Hannathon, and ends in the Jiphthahel Valley.

15 Kattath, Nahallal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

16 This is what the families of Zebulun's children will receive as their inheritance: these cities and their surrounding villages.

17 The fourth draw was for Issachar, for the families of Issachar's children.

18 Their boundary went towards Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem.

19 And Haphraim, Shihon, and Anaharath.

20 And Rabbith, Kishion, and Abez,

21 And Remeth, Engannim, Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

22 The border touches Tabor, Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh, ending at the Jordan River: sixteen cities and their villages.

23 This is what the family groups of the tribe of Issachar receive as their inheritance: the towns and their surrounding villages.

24 The fifth share was for the Asher tribe family groups.

25 Their boundary included Helkath, Hali, Beten, and Achshaph.

26 Alammelech, Amad, and Misheal; the land goes up to Carmel in the west and to Shihorlibnath.

27 It turns toward the sunrise at Bethdagon, goes to Zebulun, to the Jiphthahel Valley north of Bethemek and Neiel, and ends at Cabul on the left.

28 Hebron, Rehob, Hammon, Kanah, all the way to great Zidon;

29 Then the border turns to Ramah and the fortified city of Tyre; the border turns to Hosah, ending at the sea from the border to Achzib.

30 Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob too: twenty-two cities and their villages.

31 This is what the Asher tribe's families will receive: These towns and their surrounding villages.

32 The sixth share was given to the Naphtali people, each family group among them.

33 Their land extended from Heleph and Allon to Zaanannim, including Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum, and ended at the Jordan River.

34 Then the border turns west to Aznothtabor, goes from there to Hukkok, touches Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan River to the east.

35 The protected cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth.

36 Adamah, Ramah, and Hazor,

37 Kedesh, Edrei, and Enhazor,

38 Iron, Migdalel, Horem, Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.

39 This is what the Naphtali tribe's families will receive as their inheritance: the towns and their surrounding villages.

40 The seventh share was picked for the Dan tribe families.

41 Their land included Zorah, Eshtaol, and Irshemesh.

42 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

43 Elon, Thimnathah, and Ekron,

44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, and Baalath,

45 Jehud, Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

46 And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, along with the territory facing Japho.

47 The land for Dan's descendants was too small, so they fought against Leshem, captured it, killed its people, took it over, lived there, and renamed Leshem as Dan after their ancestor Dan.

48 This is what the Dan tribe's families inherited: these cities and their villages.

49 After they finished dividing the land for inheritance by their regions, the people of Israel gave a share to Joshua, the son of Nun.

50 Following God's instructions, they gave him the city he requested, Timnathserah in the hills of Ephraim. He then rebuilt the city and lived there.

51 These are the lands Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the tribal leaders of Israel's children divided as inheritances by drawing lots in Shiloh before God, at the entrance of the meeting tent. This is how they finished dividing the land.
