1 When the wall was finished, and I had installed the doors, and the gatekeepers, musicians, and Levites had been assigned their tasks,

2 I put my brother Hanani and Hananiah, the palace leader, in charge of Jerusalem because he was loyal and respected God more than most.

3 I told them, "Do not open Jerusalem's gates until the sun is hot. While they are there, let them close the doors, lock them, and set guards from Jerusalem's people, each in his own watch, with each guard facing his own house."

4 The city was big and important, but there were not many people living there, and the houses were not built yet.

5 God inspired me to assemble the leaders, officials, and people to record their family histories. I found the family records of those who first returned, written in the list.

6 These are the children from the area who returned from being captives, those whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had taken away. They went back to Jerusalem and Judah, each to their own city.

7 These people came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The total number of Israel's men was as follows:

8 Parosh's descendants, 2,172.

9 Shephatiah's descendants numbered 372.

10 Arah's descendants, six hundred fifty-two.

11 The descendants of Pahathmoab, from Jeshua and Joab's line, were 2,818.

12 The children of Elam, 1,254.

13 Zattu's descendants, 845.

14 Zaccai's descendants, 760.

15 Binnui's descendants, six hundred forty-eight.

16 Bebei's descendants, six hundred twenty-eight.

17 Azgad's descendants numbered two thousand three hundred and twenty-two.

18 Adonikam's descendants, six hundred and sixty-seven.

19 Bigvai's descendants, two thousand sixty-seven.

20 Adin's descendants, 655.

21 Ninety-eight descendants of Ater from Hezekiah's time.

22 Hashum's descendants were 328 people.

23 Bezai's descendants, three hundred twenty-four.

24 The Hariph family had 112 people.

25 There were ninety-five children from Gibeon.

26 The men from Bethlehem and Netophah, 188.

27 The men from Anathoth numbered one hundred and twenty-eight.

28 The 42 men from Bethazmaveth.

29 The men from Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth numbered 743.

30 The men from Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty-one.

31 The men of Michmas, one hundred twenty-two.

32 The men from Bethel and Ai, one hundred and twenty-three.

33 The men from the other Nebo, fifty-two.

34 The descendants of the other Elam, 1,254.

35 Harim's descendants, three hundred twenty.

36 Jericho had 345 children.

37 The people from Lod, Hadid, and Ono were 721.

38 The descendants of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred thirty.

39 The priests: the descendants of Jedaiah from Jeshua's family, 973 in total.

40 Immer's descendants, one thousand fifty-two.

41 Pashur's children, 1,247.

42 Harim's descendants, one thousand and seventeen.

43 The Levites included Jeshua's descendants, Kadmiel's descendants, and Hodevah's descendants, totaling 74 people.

44 The singers: Asaph's descendants, 148 of them.

45 The gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai, totaling 138.

46 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the children of Tabbaoth.

47 The families of Keros, the families of Sia, the families of Padon,

48 The descendants of Lebana, the descendants of Hagaba, the descendants of Shalmai,

49 The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar,

58 The families of Jaala, Darkon, and Giddel.

59 The descendants of Shephatiah, the descendants of Hattil, the descendants of Pochereth of Zebaim, the descendants of Amon.

60 All the temple helpers and Solomon's servants' descendants totaled 392.

61 These are the ones who came from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove which family or if they were from Israel.

62 Delaiah's descendants, Tobiah's descendants, Nekoda's descendants, 642.

63 From the priests: Habaiah's descendants, Koz's descendants, and Barzillai's descendants, who married one of Barzillai the Gileadite's daughters and took their family name.

64 These people searched for their family records among those listed by ancestry, but they could not be found. So they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood.

65 The governor told them not to eat the most holy food until a priest with Urim and Thummim came.

66 The whole group together was 42,360.

67 They had 7,337 male and female servants and 245 male and female singers.

68 They had 736 horses and 245 mules.

69 They had 435 camels and 6,720 donkeys.

70 Some family leaders donated to the project. The governor gave a thousand gold coins, fifty bowls, and five hundred thirty robes for priests to the treasury.

71 Some of the leaders gave 20,000 gold coins and 2,200 pounds of silver to the project's fund.

72 The rest of the people gave 20,000 drams of gold, 2,000 pounds of silver, and 67 priests' robes.

73 The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, some people, Nethinims, and all Israel lived in their towns. When the seventh month arrived, the Israelites were in their towns.
