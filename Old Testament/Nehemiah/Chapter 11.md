1 The leaders lived in Jerusalem. The other people drew lots so that one out of every ten would live in Jerusalem, the holy city, and the other nine in different cities.

2 The people praised everyone who willingly chose to live in Jerusalem.

3 These are the leaders of the area who lived in Jerusalem: but in the Judah towns, everyone lived on their own land, including Israelites, priests, Levites, temple workers, and descendants of Solomon's servants.

4 In Jerusalem lived some of Judah's and Benjamin's people. Of Judah's descendants, there was Athaiah, Uzziah's son, Zechariah's grandson, Amariah's great-grandson, Shephatiah's great-great-grandson, from Perez's family.

5 Maaseiah, son of Baruch, grandson of Colhozeh, great-grandson of Hazaiah, great-great-grandson of Adaiah, great-great-great-grandson of Joiarib, and great-great-great-great-grandson of Zechariah, from the family of Shiloni.

6 All of Perez's sons living in Jerusalem were 468 brave men.

7 These are Benjamin's sons: Sallu, Meshullam's son, Joed's grandson, Pedaiah's great-grandson, Kolaiah's great-great-grandson, Maaseiah's great-great-great-grandson, Ithiel's great-great-great-great-grandson, and Jesaiah's great-great-great-great-great-grandson.

8 After him Gabbai and Sallai, nine hundred twenty-eight.

9 Joel, Zichri's son, was in charge, and Judah, Senuah's son, was second in command of the city.

10 From the priests: Jedaiah, Joiarib's son, and Jachin.

11 Seraiah, son of Hilkiah, grandson of Meshullam, great-grandson of Zadok, descendant of Meraioth and Ahitub, was in charge of God's house.

12 Eight hundred and twenty-two of their brothers worked on the house. One was Adaiah, whose father was Jeroham, whose father was Pelaliah, whose father was Amzi, whose father was Zechariah, whose father was Pashur, whose father was Malchiah.

13 His brothers, leaders of the families, were 242; and Amashai, son of Azareel, grandson of Ahasai, great-grandson of Meshillemoth, and great-great-grandson of Immer.

14 Their brothers, strong and brave, 128 in number; and Zabdiel, the son of a great man, was in charge.

15 From the Levites: Shemaiah, son of Hashub, grandson of Azrikam, great-grandson of Hashabiah, from the family of Bunni.

16 Shabbethai and Jozabad, leaders of the Levites, were in charge of the external work of God's house.

17 Mattaniah, Micha's son, Zabdi's grandson, and Asaph's great-grandson, led the prayers of thanks. Bakbukiah was second to him, and Abda, Shammua's son, Galal's grandson, and Jeduthun's great-grandson, was with his brothers.

18 There were 284 Levites in the holy city.

19 The gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers who guarded the gates, were 172 in total.

20 The rest of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, lived in the towns of Judah, each in their own property.

21 The Nethinims lived in Ophel, and Ziha and Gispa were in charge of them.

22 The person in charge of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi, Bani's son, Hashabiah's grandson, Mattaniah's great-grandson, and Micha's great-great-grandson. The descendants of Asaph, who were singers, managed the work of God's house.

23 The king ordered that the singers receive a set amount every day.

24 Pethahiah, son of Meshezabeel from the descendants of Zerah of Judah, assisted the king in all issues related to the people.

25 In the villages with their lands, some people from Judah lived in Kirjatharba, its villages, Dibon, its villages, and Jekabzeel, its villages.

26 In Jeshua, in Moladah, and in Bethphilet,

27 At Hazarshual, at Beersheba, and in their villages.
