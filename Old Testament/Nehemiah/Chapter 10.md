28 The other people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all who had chosen to follow God's laws instead of the local customs, including their wives, their sons, and their daughters who were able to understand;

29 They stayed close to their kin and leaders, and took a solemn promise, committing to follow God's law that Moses, God's servant, gave them, and to follow and obey all of God's commands, rules, and laws.

30 We will not give our daughters to the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons.

31 If people in the land bring goods or food to sell on the Sabbath, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or a holy day; and we will not farm in the seventh year or demand payment of debts.

32 We agreed to give a third of a shekel each year for our God's house.

33 For the bread put on display, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offering, on the Sabbaths, on the new moon festivals, for the appointed feasts, for the sacred items, and for the sin offerings to ask for forgiveness for Israel, and for all the work in God's house.

34 We threw dice to decide which priests, Levites, and people would bring wood to God's house like our ancestors did, at set times each year, to burn on God's altar, as the law says.

35 To bring the first crops from our land and the first of all tree fruits, every year, to God's house.

36 We also give our firstborn sons and the firstborn of our livestock, as the law says, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks, to bring to God's house, for the priests working in God's house.

37 We should give the first of our dough, gifts, and all kinds of tree fruits, wine, and oil to the priests in the storerooms of God's house; and we should give a tenth of our crops to the Levites so they can have their share in all our farming towns.

38 The priest, who is Aaron's son, will be with the Levites when they collect the tithes. The Levites will take a tenth of these tithes to our God's house, into the storage rooms.

39 The people of Israel and the Levi tribe will take their grain, new wine, and oil to the storage rooms, where the holy things, the priests, the gatekeepers, and the singers are. We will not neglect our God's house.
