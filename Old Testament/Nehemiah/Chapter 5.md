1 The people and their wives raised a loud protest against their fellow Jews.

2 Some people said, "We, our sons, and our daughters are many, so we get corn for them to eat and survive."

3 Some said, "We have put our fields, vineyards, and homes up as security to buy grain because of the famine."

4 Some also said, "We have borrowed money to pay the king's tax, using our fields and vineyards as collateral."

5 Now our bodies are like our relatives' bodies, and our children like theirs. Yet, we must make our sons and daughters slaves, and some of our daughters are already enslaved. We can't free them, because others now own our lands and vineyards.

6 I was very angry when I heard their cries and these words.

7 I thought about it, and I scolded the nobles and officials, saying to them, "You charge your own people interest." Then I called a large meeting to deal with them.

8 I told them, "We have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to other nations, as much as we could. Now, are you going to sell your own people, or should they be sold to us?" They kept quiet and had nothing to say.

9 I said, "What you are doing isn't right. Shouldn't you live in fear of God to avoid the scorn of our enemies?"

10 I, my brothers, and my workers could also demand from them money and grain: I ask you, please stop charging them interest.

11 Please give back to them today their land, vineyards, olive groves, and homes. Also return the part of the money, grain, wine, and oil you have been taking from them.

12 They said, "We will give everything back and ask for nothing in return; we will do as you say." Then I gathered the priests and made them promise to do this.

13 I shook my clothes and said, "May God remove anyone from their home and job who does not keep this promise. May they be shaken out and left with nothing." Everyone agreed, saying "Amen," and praised God. The people kept the promise.

14 Since I was made governor in Judah, from the 20th to the 32nd year of King Artaxerxes, which is 12 years, neither I nor my brothers have used the food allowance given to the governor.

15 The governors before me made the people pay for their food and wine, and even took forty silver coins; their helpers also took advantage of the people. But I didn't do this because I respected God.

16 Yes, I kept working on this wall; we didn't buy any land, and all my workers came there to work.

17 Also, at my table there were one hundred and fifty Jews and leaders, in addition to the visitors from the nations around us.

18 Every day, I was given one ox, six special sheep, and some birds to eat. Also, every ten days, I received many kinds of wine. But even with all this, I didn't take the governor's food allowance because the people were already working hard.

19 Remember me, my God, for good, for everything I've done for these people.
