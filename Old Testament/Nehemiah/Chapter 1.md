1 Nehemiah son of Hachaliah spoke these words. In the month of Kislev during the twentieth year, I was at the palace in Susa.

2 My brother Hanani and some men from Judah came, and I asked them about the Jews who survived the captivity and about Jerusalem.

3 They told me that the survivors from the captivity in the province are suffering a lot and are shamed. The wall of Jerusalem is also destroyed, and its gates are burned with fire.

4 When I heard these words, I sat down and cried, and I was sad for some days, and I didn't eat, and I prayed to the God of heaven.

5 I ask you, God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his promise and kindness for those who love him and follow his commands.

6 Listen carefully and keep your eyes open, so you can hear the prayer I make before you now, day and night, for the people of Israel your servants. I admit the sins of the people of Israel, which we have done wrong against you. Both I and my family have sinned.

7 We have acted very badly towards you and have not followed your commands, laws, or rules that you gave to your servant Moses.

8 Please remember what you told your servant Moses: "If you disobey, I will spread you out among the countries."

9 If you come back to me, follow my rules, and do them, even if you were scattered to the farthest skies, I will bring you back to the place I have chosen for my name to be.

10 These are your servants and your people, whom you have saved with your great power and strong hand.

11 God, I ask you, please listen to your servant's prayer and the prayers of those who respect your name. Help your servant today, give him kindness before this man, because I served the king as his cupbearer.
