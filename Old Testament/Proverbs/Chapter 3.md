1 My son, don't forget my teachings; keep my commands in your heart.

2 They will add to you many days, a long life, and peace.

3 Do not let kindness and honesty leave you; tie them around your neck and write them on your heart.

4 You will find favor and good understanding with both God and people.

5 Trust God with all your heart; do not rely on your own understanding.

6 In everything you do, recognize God, and he will guide your paths.

7 Don't think you know everything; respect God, and stay away from bad things.

8 It will be good for your body and strength for your bones.

9 Honor God with your possessions and with the first part of everything you earn.

10 Your storerooms will be filled with lots of food, and your vats will overflow with new wine.

11 My son, do not hate God's discipline; do not get tired of his correction.

12 God corrects those he loves, just as a father corrects the son he enjoys.

13 The person who finds wisdom and gains understanding is happy.

14 Its goods are better than silver, and its profits better than gold.

15 She is more valuable than rubies; nothing you want can compare to her.

16 She offers a long life with her right hand; with her left hand, she brings wealth and respect.

17 Her ways are nice, and all her paths bring peace.

18 She is like a life-giving tree to those who hold on to her; and everyone who keeps her is happy.

19 God used wisdom to create the earth and with understanding set up the heavens.

20 With his knowledge, the deep places are split open, and the clouds release the dew.

21 My son, always keep wisdom and good judgement in sight.

22 They will bring life to you and charm to how you carry yourself.

23 You will walk safely on your path, and you will not trip.

24 When you lie down, you will not be scared; you will rest, and your sleep will be peaceful.

25 Do not be scared of sudden fear, or the destruction of the wicked, when it happens.

26 God will be your trust, and will protect you from getting caught in a trap.

27 Don't hold back good from those who deserve it when you can do it.

28 Don't tell your neighbor, "Go away and come back later, I'll give it to you tomorrow," when you have it with you now.

29 Do not plan to harm your neighbor, who lives trustingly near you.

30 Do not argue with someone for no reason if they have not harmed you.

31 Do not envy the bully, and do not follow any of his ways.

32 God hates deceitful people but shares secrets with the good.

33 God's curse is on the wicked's house, but he blesses the home of the righteous.

34 God mocks the mockers but gives kindness to the humble.

35 Smart people will receive honor, but fools will get disgrace.
