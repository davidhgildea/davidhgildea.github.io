1 Wisdom built her house; she carved out its seven pillars.

2 She has killed her animals; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.

3 She has sent out her servant girls; she calls out from the city's highest spots.

4 If you are simple, come this way; anyone lacking understanding, she says to him,

5 Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine I have mixed.

6 Leave the foolish behind and live; walk on the path of wisdom.

7 The person who corrects a mocker invites insult, and the one who tells a wicked person they are wrong risks being shamed.

8 Don't correct a mocker, or he will dislike you; advise a wise person, and he will appreciate you.

9 Guide a smart person, and they will become smarter; show a fair person, and their knowledge will grow.

10 Being in awe of God is the start of wisdom, and knowing what is sacred leads to understanding.

11 With my help, your life will last longer, and you'll have more years to live.

12 If you are wise, you will benefit yourself: but if you mock, you alone will suffer.

13 A silly woman is loud: she is naive, and knows nothing.

14 She sits at her house door, on a chair in the city's high spots.

15 To invite people who are traveling straight on their paths:

16 If you are simple, come here; if you lack understanding, she says to you.

17 Taken water tastes good, and hidden bread is nice to eat.

18 He doesn't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave.
