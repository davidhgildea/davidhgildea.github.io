1 My child, if you accept my words and keep my commands with you;

2 Listen closely to wisdom, and focus your mind on understanding.

3 Yes, if you call out for knowledge and raise your voice for understanding;

4 If you seek wisdom like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures;

5 Then you will understand what it means to respect God and you will discover God's knowledge.

6 God gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.

7 He saves true wisdom for the good people: he protects those who act honestly.

8 He protects the paths of fairness and guards the way of his faithful people.

9 Then you will understand what is right, fair, and justâ€”every good way.

10 When wisdom comes into your heart, and knowledge is pleasing to your soul;

11 Wisdom will protect you, and understanding will guard you.

12 To save you from the path of the bad man, from the one who says twisted things.

13 They leave the right paths to walk in dark ways.

14 They enjoy doing wrong and take pleasure in the twisted ways of the wicked.

15 Their ways are dishonest, and they are stubborn in their paths.

16 To save you from the foreign woman, from the outsider who seduces with her words;

17 She leaves the companion of her youth and forgets the promise of her God.

18 Her house leads to death, and her paths go to the dead.

19 Everyone who goes to her does not come back, nor do they find the way to life.

20 So you can follow the path of good people and stay on the way of those who do right.

21 Good people will live in the land, and the blameless will stay in it.

22 The evil people will be removed from the earth, and those who break the rules will be completely taken out of it.
