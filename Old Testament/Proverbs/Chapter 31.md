1 The sayings of King Lemuel, the teaching his mother gave him.

2 What should I say, my son? What, child of my body? What, child of my promises?

3 Do not give your strength to women, or your paths to what ruins kings.

4 Kings should not drink wine, Lemuel, nor should leaders drink strong alcohol.

5 They might drink, forget the rules, and twist the justice due to those who are suffering.

6 Give hard liquor to someone who is dying, and wine to those who are very sad.

7 Let him drink and forget his lack of money, and not recall his troubles anymore.

8 Speak up for those who cannot speak, in the defense of all who are headed for ruin.

9 Speak up, make fair decisions, and defend the rights of the poor and needy.

10 Who can find a good woman? Her value is much higher than jewels.

11 Her husband's heart trusts her deeply, so he lacks nothing of value.

12 She will treat him well and never badly all her life.

13 She looks for wool and flax and works eagerly with her hands.

14 She is like the traders' boats; she gets her food from far away.

15 She gets up while it's still night, and provides food for her family, and shares with her servant girls.

16 She thinks about a field, buys it, and with her own work, she plants a vineyard.

17 She wraps her waist with power and makes her arms strong.

18 She sees that her goods are valuable; her lamp does not go out at night.

19 She puts her hands to the spindle and holds the distaff.

20 She extends her hand to the poor; yes, she offers her hands to those in need.

21 She is not worried about the cold for her family, because they all wear warm red clothes.

22 She makes herself patterned blankets; her clothes are silk and purple.

23 Her husband is respected in the community where he meets with the local leaders.

24 She makes good linen cloth and sells it; she also delivers belts to the shopkeeper.

25 She wears strength and respect; she will be glad in the future.

26 She speaks wisely and kindly advice is on her tongue.

27 She takes good care of her family and does not waste time doing nothing.

28 Her children stand up and call her blessed; her husband too, and he praises her.

29 Many women have been good, but you are the best of them all.

30 Being liked for charm is misleading, and beauty is shallow: but a woman who respects God will be honored.

31 Give her the rewards of her work, and let her actions praise her publicly.
