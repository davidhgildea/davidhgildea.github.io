1 It is better to have a little with peace than a house full of food with fighting.

2 A smart servant will be in charge instead of a son who brings shame, and will share in the family inheritance.

3 A melting pot is for silver, and a furnace is for gold, but God tests the heart.

4 A bad person listens to lies, and a liar pays attention to hurtful words.

5 Anyone who mocks the poor insults God, and those who are happy when others suffer will be punished.

6 Grandchildren are a joy to the elderly; and children take pride in their parents.

7 Good words are not fitting for a fool; even less are lies suitable for a leader.

8 A gift is like a valuable gem to the person who has it: wherever it goes, it succeeds.

9 Whoever forgives an offense shows love; but one who keeps talking about the issue pushes friends apart.

10 A correction is understood better by a wise person than a hundred beatings are by a fool.

11 A bad person looks for trouble, so a harsh messenger will be sent to him.

12 It's better to meet a mother bear who has lost her cubs than a fool doing something stupid.

13 Anyone who pays back good with evil will always have evil in their home.

14 Strife starts like a water leak, so stop arguing before it gets worse.

15 Anyone who says the bad person is right, and anyone who says the good person is wrong, both are hated by God.

16 Why does a fool have money to buy wisdom when he has no desire for it?

17 A friend always loves, and a brother is there for tough times.

18 A person without good sense shakes hands in agreement, promising to pay for his friend.

19 Someone who loves fighting loves to sin; and one who makes their entrance grand is looking for ruin.

20 Someone with a crooked heart finds no good, and a person with a twisted tongue gets into trouble.

21 Whoever has a foolish child brings sorrow to themselves; a fool's parent has no happiness.

22 A happy heart is good for you like medicine, but a sad spirit dries up the bones.

23 A bad person takes a bribe secretly to twist fair decisions.

24 The wise person keeps wisdom in view, but a fool's gaze wanders to the ends of the earth.

25 A silly son makes his father sad and his mother bitter.

26 It is wrong to punish the innocent, and it is not good to hit leaders for doing right.

27 Someone with knowledge uses few words: a person with understanding has a calm spirit.

28 Even a fool seems wise if they stay silent, and a person who keeps their mouth shut is thought to be smart.
