1 They brought God's ark and placed it inside the tent David set up for it; they gave burnt sacrifices and peace offerings to God.

2 After David finished giving the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in God's name.

3 He gave every person in Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a nice piece of meat, and a bottle of wine.

4 He chose some Levites to serve before God's ark, to keep records, and to thank and praise the God of Israel.

5 Asaph was the leader, with Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obed-edom next to him. Jeiel played the psalteries and harps, while Asaph played the cymbals.

6 Benaiah and Jahaziel, who were priests, always played trumpets in front of God's covenant box.

7 On that day, David first gave this psalm to thank God to Asaph and his brothers.

8 Give thanks to God, call on his name, tell everyone about what he has done.

9 Sing to him, sing songs to him, talk about all his amazing works.

10 Celebrate God's holy name: let those who look for God be happy in their hearts.

11 Look for God and his power, always search for his presence.

12 Remember the amazing things God has done, his miracles, and the decisions he has spoken.

13 You descendants of Israel, God's servants, you offspring of Jacob, his chosen people.

14 He is our God; his decisions are everywhere on earth.

15 Always remember God's agreement, the promise he gave for a thousand generations.

16 About the promise God made to Abraham, and the pledge to Isaac;

17 God made it a law for Jacob and a forever promise to Israel.

18 God said, "I will give you the land of Canaan as your inheritance."

19 When you were only a few people, strangers in the land.

20 As they moved from one country to another and from one kingdom to a different nation;

21 He did not let anyone harm them; indeed, he scolded kings for their protection.

22 "God said, 'Do not harm my chosen ones, and do not hurt my prophets.'"

23 Sing to God, all the earth; show his salvation every day.

24 Tell everyone about God's greatness; share the amazing things He does with all people.

25 God is great and deserves much praise; we should also fear him more than any other gods.

26 All other people's gods are just idols, but God created the skies.

27 God's presence brings glory and honor; His place is filled with strength and joy.

28 Give to God, you families of the people, give to God glory and strength.

29 Give God the honor that belongs to his name; bring a gift and come before him; worship God in the beauty of being holy.

30 All the earth, be in awe of God; the world will be firm and not shake.

31 Let the sky be happy, and the earth be joyful, and let people tell all countries, "God rules."

32 Let the sea make noise and everything in it; let the fields be happy and everything in them.

33 The trees of the forest will sing when God comes, because he is coming to judge the world.

34 Give thanks to God, for he is good, for his kindness lasts forever.

35 Say to God, "Save us, Savior, bring us together, and free us from other nations, so we can thank your holy name and find joy in praising you."

36 Praise God of Israel forever and ever. And all the people said, "Amen," and praised God.

37 He left Asaph and his brothers there in front of God's covenant chest to serve continually, as each day needed.

38 Obededom and his 68 brothers, along with the sons of Jeduthun and Hosah, served as gatekeepers.

39 Priest Zadok and his fellow priests served at God's tent on the high ground in Gibeon.

40 To give burnt sacrifices to God on the altar for burnt sacrifices always in the morning and in the evening, and to do everything that is written in God's law that he gave to Israel.

41 Along with them were Heman and Jeduthun, and the others who were selected and named, to thank God, because his mercy lasts forever.

42 Heman and Jeduthun joined them with trumpets and cymbals to make music and with God's instruments. Jeduthun's sons were gatekeepers.

43 All the people went to their own homes, and David went back to bless his family.
