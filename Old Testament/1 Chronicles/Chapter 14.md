1 Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David with cedar wood, stone workers, and carpenters to build a house for him.

2 David realized that God had established him as king over Israel because his kingdom was highly honored due to the people of Israel.

3 David married more women in Jerusalem and had more sons and daughters.

4 These are the names of his children born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon.

5 Ibhar, Elishua, and Elpalet,

6 Nogah, Nepheg, and Japhia,

7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

8 When the Philistines learned David was made king over all of Israel, they all went to find David. David found out and went to face them.

9 The Philistines came and spread out in the Rephaim Valley.

10 David asked God, "Should I go fight the Philistines? Will you give them to me?" And God said to him, "Go; I will give them to you."

11 They went to Baalperazim, and David defeated them there. Then David said, God has helped me defeat my enemies like water bursting through. So they named that place Baalperazim.

12 After they had abandoned their gods, David ordered them to be burned.

13 The Philistines once more spread out in the valley.

14 David asked God again, and God told him, "Do not chase them; go around them and attack from near the mulberry trees."

15 When you hear a rustling in the mulberry trees, then move out to fight because God has gone ahead of you to strike down the Philistine army.

16 David did as God told him, and they defeated the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gazer.

17 David became famous in all the lands and God made all nations fear him.
