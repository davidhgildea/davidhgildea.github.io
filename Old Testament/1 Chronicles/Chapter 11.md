1 All Israel came to David in Hebron and said, "Look, we are your own flesh and bone."

2 Even before, when Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel: and God told you, "You will take care of my people Israel, and you will lead them."

3 So all the leaders of Israel went to the king at Hebron. There, in Hebron, David agreed with them before God; and they made David the king over Israel, as God had said through Samuel.

4 David and all of Israel went to Jerusalem, also known as Jebus, where the Jebusites lived in the land.

5 The people of Jebus told David, "You will not come here." But David captured the fortress of Zion, which is the city of David.

6 David said, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become the leader and commander." So Joab, Zeruiah's son, led the attack and became the leader.

7 David lived in the stronghold, so they named it David's city.

8 He built the city all around, from Millo and around it, and Joab fixed the rest of the city.

9 David became more and more powerful because God was with him.

10 These men were also leaders of the strong warriors who supported David and helped make him king over all Israel, as God had promised concerning Israel.

11 David had strong soldiers; Jashobeam, from Hachmon, led the captains. He fought and defeated three hundred enemies at once with his spear.

12 After him came Eleazar, son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three strongest warriors.

13 He was with David at Pasdammim, where the Philistines had come to fight, and there was a field of barley; the people ran away from the Philistines.

14 They took their position in the middle of the land, saved it, and killed the Philistines; and God rescued them with a great victory.

15 Three of the thirty leaders went to the rock to meet David at the cave of Adullam, while the Philistine army camped in Rephaim Valley.

16 David was in the stronghold, and the Philistines' fort was at Bethlehem at that time.

17 David felt a deep desire and said, "I wish someone would bring me water from the Bethlehem well by the gate!"

18 The three men fought through the Philistine army and got water from the Bethlehem well by the gate. They brought it to David, but he wouldn't drink it and poured it out to God.

19 He said, "God stop me from doing this. Should I drink what these men risked their lives to get? They risked their lives to bring it." So he refused to drink it. This is what the three bravest did.

20 Abishai, Joab's brother, was the leader of the three. By using his spear to defeat three hundred, he killed them and became famous among the three.

21 Among the three, he was the most respected because he was their leader, but he did not reach the level of the top three.

22 Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, from Kabzeel, who was brave and did many things, killed two strong Moab men and also killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day.

23 He killed an Egyptian, a very tall man about seven and a half feet tall; the Egyptian had a spear as thick as a weaver's rod; but he attacked with just a stick, grabbed the spear from the Egyptian, and killed him with it.

24 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, did these things and was known as one of the three mightiest.

25 Look, he was respected among the thirty, but did not reach the top three; and David put him in charge of his bodyguards.

26 The brave soldiers included Asahel, Joab's brother, and Elhanan, Dodo's son from Bethlehem.

27 Shammah from Harar, Helez from Pela.

28 Ira, son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, and Abiezer from Anathoth,

29 Sibbecai from Hushath, Ilai from Ahoah,

30 Maharai from Netophah, Heled, Baanah's son, from Netophah,

31 Ithai, Ribai's son from Gibeah of Benjamin's descendants, Benaiah from Pirathon,

32 Hurai from the Gaash creeks, Abiel the Arbathite.

33 Azmaveth from Baharum, Eliahba from Shaalbon,

34 Hashem's sons from Gizon, Jonathan, Shage's son from Harar,

35 Ahiam, Sacar the Hararite's son, Eliphal, Ur's son.

36 Hepher from Mekerah, Ahijah from Pelon.

37 Hezro from Carmel, Naarai, Ezbai's son,

38 Joel Nathan's brother, Mibhar Haggeri's son,

39 Zelek from Ammon, Naharai from Beroth, Joab's armor carrier, Zeruiah's son.

40 Ira from Ithra, Gareb from Ithra,

41 Uriah from Hittite people, Zabad son of Ahlai,

42 Adina, Shiza's son from the tribe of Reuben, was a leader, and he was with thirty others.

43 Hanan, Maachah's son, and Joshaphat, from Mithni.

44 Uzzia from Ashterath, Shama and Jehiel who are Hothan's sons from Aroer,

45 Jediael, Shimri's son, and his brother Joha, the Tizite,

46 Eliel from Mahavah, Jeribai, and Joshaviah, Elnaam's sons, and Ithmah from Moab,

47 Eliel, Obed, and Jasiel from Mesoba.
