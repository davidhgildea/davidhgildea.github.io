1 After this, David defeated the Philistines, overpowered them, and captured Gath and its surrounding towns from the Philistines.

2 He defeated Moab, and the Moabites became David's servants, bringing him gifts.

3 David defeated King Hadarezer of Zobah as far as Hamath while he was expanding his territory to the Euphrates River.

4 David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David also crippled all the chariot horses, but saved a hundred chariots.

5 When the soldiers from Damascus came to help King Hadarezer of Zobah, David killed 22,000 Syrian men.

6 David placed military posts in Syrian Damascus; the Syrians became David's subjects and brought presents. So God protected David wherever he went.

7 David took the golden shields from Hadarezer's servants and brought them to Jerusalem.

8 David took a lot of bronze from the cities of Tibhath and Chun, which belonged to Hadadezer, and Solomon used it to make the bronze sea, pillars, and bronze objects.

9 When Tou, the king of Hamath, found out that David had defeated the entire army of Hadarezer, the king of Zobah;

10 He sent his son Hadoram to King David to ask about his health and to celebrate with him because he defeated Hadarezer, who had been at war with Tou, and he brought with him many items made of gold, silver, and bronze.

11 King David also dedicated these things to God, along with the silver and gold he had taken from various nations: Edom, Moab, Ammon's descendants, the Philistines, and Amalek.

12 Abishai, son of Zeruiah, killed 18,000 Edomites in the Salt Valley.

13 He placed guards in Edom, and all the Edomites served David. God protected David wherever he went.

14 David ruled over all of Israel and made fair decisions and laws for his people.

15 Joab, Zeruiah's son, commanded the army; and Jehoshaphat, Ahilud's son, was the historian.

16 Zadok, Ahitub's son, and Abimelech, Abiathar's son, were priests; Shavsha was the secretary.

17 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, commanded the Cherethites and Pelethites; David's sons were the main leaders around the king.
