1 When the year ended, at the time kings usually go to battle, Joab took the army out, destroyed the land of the Ammonites, and attacked Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab conquered Rabbah and ruined it.

2 David took the crown from their king's head, saw it was as heavy as a talent of gold with precious stones, put it on his own head, and took a lot of valuable things from the city.

3 He took out the people in it and cut them with saws, iron tools, and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and everyone went back to Jerusalem.

4 After this, there was a war at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the giants, and they were defeated.

5 The war with the Philistines began again; and Elhanan, son of Jair, killed Lahmi, Goliath's brother, who had a spear shaft as big as a weaver's rod.

6 War happened again in Gath, where a very tall man lived with 24 fingers and toes, six on each hand and foot. He was also the giant's son.

7 When he challenged Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.

8 These were the children of the giant in Gath; and they were defeated by David and his men.
