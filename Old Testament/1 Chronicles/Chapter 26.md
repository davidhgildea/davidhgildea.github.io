1 About the groups of gatekeepers: Meshelemiah, son of Kore and descendant of Asaph, was from the Korahites.

2 Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the oldest, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

3 Elam was number five, Jehohanan number six, Elioenai number seven.

4 Obededom's sons were Shemaiah the oldest, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth.

5 Ammiel was number six, Issachar number seven, Peulthai number eight, because God blessed him.

6 Shemaiah's son had sons who led over their father's household because they were brave and strong.

7 Shemaiah's sons were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad. Their strong brothers were Elihu and Semachiah.

8 All these were sons of Obededom, along with their sons and brothers, strong and able for the work. There were sixty-two of Obededom's family.

9 Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, strong men, totaling eighteen.

10 Hosah, from Merari's descendants, had sons; Simri was the leader, because even if he wasn't the firstborn, his father made him the leader.

11 Hilkiah was number two, Tebaliah number three, Zechariah number four: Hosah had thirteen sons and brothers in total.

12 These groups were the gatekeepers, among the leaders, taking turns to serve in God's house.

13 They drew lots, both young and old, by their families, for each gate.

14 The land to the east was given to Shelemiah. For his son Zechariah, who was a wise advisor, they drew lots; Zechariah's land was to the north.

15 To Obededom in the south; and to his sons the gatehouse.

16 Shuppim and Hosah were chosen by lot for the west side, near Shallecheth Gate by the ascending road, each group opposite the other.

17 To the east there were six Levites, to the north four each day, to the south four each day, and at Asuppim two by two.

18 In the west at Parbar, there are four guards at the road and two at Parbar.

19 These are the groups of gatekeepers from the descendants of Kore and the descendants of Merari.

20 Ahijah the Levite was in charge of the treasures of God's house and the treasures given to God.

21 The descendants of Laadan, who were part of the Gershon family of Levites, included the family leaders, and Jehieli was their chief.

22 Jehieli's sons were Zetham and his brother Joel, who were in charge of God's house treasures.

23 From the families of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel:

24 Shebuel, Gershom's son and Moses's grandson, was in charge of the treasures.

25 His brothers through Eliezer were: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.

26 Shelomith and his brothers took care of all the special treasure gifts that King David, the family leaders, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the army leaders had given to God.

27 From the goods taken in wars, they set apart some to support the house of God.

28 Everything that Samuel the prophet, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah had dedicated, along with anything else dedicated by anyone, was under the care of Shelomith and his brothers.

29 Chenaniah and his sons from the Izharites were in charge of Israel's external affairs, serving as officers and judges.

30 From the Hebron people, Hashabiah and his brothers, brave men totaling 1,700, were leaders in Israel on the west side of the Jordan River, handling all of God's work and the king's service.

31 Jerijah was the leader of the Hebronites, tracing back through his ancestors. In King David's fortieth year as king, they looked for these people and found brave warriors in Jazer of Gilead.

32 His brothers, brave men, numbered 2,700 leaders, whom King David appointed to oversee the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for all matters related to God and the king's business.
