1 Reuben was Israel's first son, but since he dishonored his father's bed, his rights as firstborn were given to Joseph's sons instead, and his family line did not get the firstborn's rights.

2 Judah became stronger than his brothers, and from him came the main leader, but Joseph received the birthright.

3 Reuben, Israel's first son, had these sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

4 Joel's sons were Shemaiah, then Gog, then Shimei.

5 Micah's son, Reaia's son, Baal's son,

6 Beerah was his son. The Assyrian king, Tilgathpilneser, took him away as a prisoner. He was a leader of the Reubenites.

7 His brothers, organized by families, when their family tree was recorded, had as leaders Jeiel and Zechariah.

8 Bela, son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Joel, lived in Aroer, reaching to Nebo and Baalmeon.

9 He lived to the east, up to the desert edge, by the Euphrates River because they had lots of animals in Gilead.

10 During Saul's time, they fought against the Hagarites, defeated them, and lived in their camps across the eastern region of Gilead.

11 The Gad children lived across from them in Bashan land up to Salcah.

12 Joel was the leader, Shapham was second, then Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

13 Their family members from their father's house were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, Zia, and Heberâ€”seven in total.

14 These are the descendants of Abihail: Huri's child, Jaroah's child, Gilead's child, Michael's child, Jeshishai's child, Jahdo's child, Buz's child.

15 Ahi, son of Abdiel, son of Guni, leader of their family.

16 They lived in Gilead, in Bashan, its villages, and all the surrounding areas of Sharon, right up to their borders.

17 All these people were listed in family records during the time of Jotham, king of Judah, and during the time of Jeroboam, king of Israel.

18 Reuben's sons, the Gadites, and half of the Manasseh tribe, brave men good at fighting, carrying shields and swords, shooting arrows, and skilled in battle, totaled 44,760 warriors ready for war.

19 They fought against the Hagarites, Jetur, Nephish, and Nodab.

20 They were helped in the fight against them, and their enemies, the Hagarites, were defeated. Everyone who was with the Hagarites was also defeated, because during the battle they called out to God, and he listened to them since they trusted in him.

21 They took their animals: 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys, and 100,000 people.

22 Many people were killed because the war was directed by God. They lived in those places until they were captured.

23 The children from part of the Manasseh tribe lived in the land; they grew in numbers from Bashan to Baalhermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon.

24 These were the leaders of their families: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, strong and well-known men, leaders of their families.

25 They sinned against their ancestors' God and chased after the local people's gods, even though God had destroyed those people before them.

26 God moved the hearts of Pul, the king of Assyria, and Tilgathpilneser, the king of Assyria, who then took the people of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh captive. He brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river Gozan, where they are to this day.
