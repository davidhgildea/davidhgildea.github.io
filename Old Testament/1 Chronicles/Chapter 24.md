1 These are the groups of Aaron's sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no kids, so Eleazar and Ithamar became priests.

3 David assigned roles to them: Zadok from Eleazar's descendants and Ahimelech from Ithamar's descendants, based on their duties in their service.

4 There were more leaders from Eleazar's sons than from Ithamar's sons, and they were split up this way: Sixteen leaders from Eleazar's family and eight from Ithamar's family.

5 They were separated by drawing lots, each group equally; because leaders of the sanctuary and leaders of God's house came from both Eleazar's descendants and Ithamar's descendants.

6 Shemaiah, Nethaneel's son and a writer, recorded names for the king, leaders, priest Zadok, Ahimelech (Abiathar's son), and the head priests and Levites. They chose one main family for Eleazar and one for Ithamar.

7 The first turn went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah.

8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim.

9 The fifth lot came out for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin.

10 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah.

11 The ninth for Jeshuah, the tenth for Shecaniah.

12 Eliashib got the eleventh turn, and Jakim got the twelfth.

13 The thirteenth is to Huppah, the fourteenth is to Jeshebeab.

14 The fifteenth lot fell to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer.

15 The seventeenth lot fell to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses.

16 The nineteenth lot fell to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel.

17 The twenty-first lot was for Jachin, the twenty-second lot was for Gamul.

18 The twenty-third lot fell to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.

19 These were the rules for them in serving and entering God's house, following their customs under the leadership of Aaron their father, as God of Israel had commanded him.

20 The other descendants of Levi included: from Amram's line, Shubael; and from Shubael's line, Jehdeiah.

21 About Rehabiah: Isshiah was the first of Rehabiah's sons.

22 From the Izharites, Shelomoth; from Shelomoth's sons, Jahath.

23 Hebron's sons were Jeriah first, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, and Jekameam fourth.

24 Uzziel's sons included Michah, and Michah's sons included Shamir.

25 Michah's brother was Isshiah. Isshiah's son was Zechariah.

26 Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi; and Jaaziah's son was Beno.

27 Merari's sons were Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.

28 Mahli's family included Eleazar, but he had no children.

29 About Kish: Kish's son was Jerahmeel.

30 Mushi's sons were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the Levites' sons, grouped by their fathers' families.

31 They also cast lots like their brothers, the sons of Aaron, in front of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the leaders of the priests' and Levites' families, with the most important fathers facing their younger brothers.
