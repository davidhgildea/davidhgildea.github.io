1 All the people of Israel were listed by their family lines; and, look, they were written in the record of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were taken to Babylon because they did wrong.

2 The first people who lived in their own cities on their land were the Israelites, priests, Levites, and Nethinims.

17 The gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, and Ahiman, along with their brothers; Shallum was the leader.

18 They waited before at the king's gate to the east; they were gatekeepers among the groups of Levi's descendants.

19 Shallum, Kore's son, Ebiasaph's grandson, and Korah's great-grandson, and his family, the Korahites, were in charge of the work and the doors of the sacred tent. Their ancestors had guarded the entrance as leaders of God's army.

20 Phinehas, son of Eleazar, was their leader before, and God was with him.

21 Zechariah, Meshelemiah's son, was the gatekeeper of the tent where the meeting took place.

22 All these chosen as gatekeepers numbered 212. They were listed by their family histories in their towns, whom David and Samuel the seer appointed to their duties.

23 They and their children were in charge of guarding the gates of God's house, that is, the tent of worship, in different shifts.

24 The guards were in four areas, facing east, west, north, and south.

25 Their relatives from the villages were to join them every seven days, taking turns.

26 These four main guards were Levites. They had their assigned duties and were in charge of the rooms and storerooms of God's house.

27 They stayed near God's house because they were responsible for it and it was their duty to open it every morning.

28 Some of them were responsible for serving with the vessels, counting them as they brought them in and out.

29 Some were chosen to look after the containers, all the tools of the holy place, the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the incense, and the spices.

30 Some priest's sons made the spice ointment.

31 Mattithiah, a Levite and firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was in charge of preparing the bread in the pans.

32 Other relatives from the Kohathite family were in charge of making the special bread for every Sabbath.
