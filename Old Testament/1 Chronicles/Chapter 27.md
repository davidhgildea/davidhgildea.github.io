1 The Israelite people were organized by their families, with leaders and commanders for groups of one thousand and one hundred, and officials who worked for the king on different tasks. These groups took turns each month over the year, with each group having twenty-four thousand members.

2 For the first division in the first month, Jashobeam son of Zabdiel was in charge, and his division had 24,000 men.

5 The third army leader for the third month was Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, a head priest, and he had 24,000 men in his group.

6 This is Benaiah, who was a strong warrior among the thirty leaders and ranked above them. His son Ammizabad was in his division.

7 The fourth leader for the fourth month was Asahel, Joab's brother, with his son Zebadiah following him. He commanded 24,000 men.

15 The twelfth leader for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, from Othniel's family, and his group had twenty-four thousand men.

16 In charge of the tribes of Israel: the leader of the Reubenites was Eliezer, Zichri's son, and for the Simeonites, Shephatiah, Maachah's son.

17 From the Levites, Hashabiah son of Kemuel; from the descendants of Aaron, Zadok.

18 From Judah, Elihu, one of David's brothers; from Issachar, Omri, Michael's son.

22 From the tribe of Dan, Azareel son of Jeroham was the leader. These men were the chiefs of Israel's tribes.

23 David did not count the people under twenty years old, because God had promised to make Israel as numerous as the stars in the sky.

24 Joab, Zeruiah's son, started counting, but did not finish because God's anger fell on Israel for it; the count was not included in King David's records.

25 Azmaveth, son of Adiel, was in charge of the king's treasures, and Jehonathan, son of Uzziah, was responsible for the storehouses in the fields, cities, villages, and fortresses.

30 Obil the Ishmaelite was in charge of the camels, and Jehdeiah the Meronothite was in charge of the donkeys.

31 Jaziz the Hagerite was in charge of the flocks. All these men were leaders of King David's property.

32 Jonathan, David's uncle, was an advisor, a wise man, and a writer; and Jehiel, Hachmoni's son, stayed with the king's sons.

33 Ahithophel was the king's advisor, and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend.

34 After Ahithophel came Jehoiada, son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was the commander of the kingâ€™s army.
