1 Celebrate happily before God, all you lands.

2 Sing to honor God's name; make your praises of him wonderful.

3 Tell God, "How awesome are your deeds! Because of your great power, your enemies will come to you in submission."

4 Everyone on earth will worship you and sing to you; they will sing about your name. Pause.

5 Come and see what God has done; he is awesome in his actions among people.

6 He turned the sea into dry land; they walked through the river on foot; there we were happy in him.

7 He rules forever by his power; his eyes watch the nations: rebellious people should not lift themselves up. Pause.

8 Praise our God, everyone, and let his praise be heard.

9 God keeps us alive and does not let us stumble.

10 God, you have tested us; you have refined us like silver.

11 You caught us in a trap; you put a heavy burden on our backs.

12 You let people walk over us; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.

13 I will enter your house with offerings; I will fulfill my promises to you.

14 What I said with my lips and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.

15 I will give you burnt offerings of young animals and the scent of rams; I will present bulls and goats. Pause and think about that.

16 Come and listen, all who respect God, and I will tell what he did for my life.

17 I called out to God with my mouth, and I praised him with my tongue.

18 If I keep sin in my heart, God will not listen to me.

19 God truly heard me; he listened to my prayer.

20 Praise God, who did not ignore my prayer or withdraw his kindness from me.
