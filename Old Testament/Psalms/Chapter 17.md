1 Listen to me, God, hear my cry, pay attention to my prayer that comes from honest lips.

2 Let your decision come from your presence; let your eyes see what is fair.

3 You have tested my heart; you have visited me at night; you have examined me and will find no wrong; I have decided that my mouth will not sin.

4 About what people do, following what you have said, I have stayed away from the harmful ways.

5 Guide my steps on your paths, so I don't slip.

6 I have called to you, because you will listen to me, God: turn your ear to me, and listen to what I say.

7 Show your wonderful love, O God, who saves with your right hand those who trust in you from their enemies.

8 Protect me like you would your most cherished possession; hide me in the safety of your wings.

9 Save me from the wicked who attack me, from my deadly enemies who surround me.

10 They are surrounded by their own fat; they speak with proud mouths.

11 They have surrounded us wherever we go. They watch us closely, looking to the ground.

12 Like a lion hungry for its catch, and like a young lion hiding and waiting.

13 Stand up, God, let him be defeated and pushed down: save me from the evil one who is your weapon.

14 You save me from people, God, from worldly people who get their share in this life, whose stomach you fill with your treasures: they have many children and leave what's left to their little ones.

15 I will see your face in fairness; I will be content when I wake up to be like you.
