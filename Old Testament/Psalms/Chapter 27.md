1 God is my light and my rescue; who should I fear? God is the power of my life; who should I be scared of?

2 When the bad people, my enemies, attacked me to destroy me, they tripped and fell.

3 Even if an army surrounds me, I won't be afraid; even if I am threatened by war, I will remain confident.

4 I want one thing from God and I will look for it: to live in God's house all my life, to see how beautiful God is, and to learn in his holy place.

5 When trouble comes, God will protect me in His shelter; He will keep me safe in His tent and lift me onto a rock.

6 Now I will hold my head high above my enemies around me. So I will give joyful sacrifices in his tent; I will sing and praise God.

7 Listen, God, when I call out loud: be kind to me and respond to me.

8 When you said, "Look for me," my heart responded, "I will look for you, God."

9 Don't hide from me; don't turn me away in anger. You have been my help; don't leave or abandon me, God who saves me.

10 When my father and my mother leave me, then God will take care of me.

11 Teach me your way, God, and guide me on a clear path because of my enemies.

12 Do not give me up to my enemies' wishes; false witnesses have stood against me, speaking cruelty.

13 I would have lost hope if I didn't believe I would see God's goodness while I'm alive.

14 Wait for God; be brave, and He will make your heart strong; I say, wait for God.
