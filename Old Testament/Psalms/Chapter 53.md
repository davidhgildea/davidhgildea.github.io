1 The fool thinks, "There is no God." They are corrupt and do very bad things; no one does good.

2 God watched from heaven to see if any humans were wise and searching for God.

3 Every one has turned away; they have all become dirty; no one does good, not even one.

4 Do the workers of evil not understand? They consume my people like bread: they have not called on God.

5 They were very scared where there was no reason to fear, because God has spread out the bones of your enemies; you have made them feel ashamed, because God has rejected them.

6 I wish Israel's rescue would come from Zion! When God frees His people, Jacob will be happy, and Israel will be joyful.
