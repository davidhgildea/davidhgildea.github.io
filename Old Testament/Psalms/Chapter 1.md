1 Happy is the person who does not follow bad advice, does not hang out with sinners, and does not join those who make fun of others.

2 He enjoys following God's law and thinks about it all day and night.

3 He will be like a tree by the water that grows fruit at the right time; its leaves will not dry out, and everything he does will succeed.

4 The wicked are not like this; they are like the dry husks that the wind blows away.

5 So, the wicked won't stand when judged, nor will sinners be with the group of good people.

6 God knows the path of good people, but the way of the bad will disappear.
