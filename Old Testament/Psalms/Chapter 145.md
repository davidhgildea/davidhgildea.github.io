1 I will praise you, my God, the king; and I will bless your name always and forever.

2 I will bless you every day; I will praise your name forever and ever.

3 God is great and deserves much praise; no one can understand how great he is.

4 One generation will tell the next about your works and talk about your powerful deeds.

5 I will talk about the glorious honor of your majesty and your amazing works.

6 People will talk about how powerful your amazing acts are, and I will tell others about your greatness.

7 They will speak often of your great kindness and sing about your fairness.

8 God is kind and caring; patient and very merciful.

9 God is good to everyone, and his compassion is on all he has made.

10 Everything you have made will praise you, God; and your holy people will bless you.

11 They will talk about the greatness of your kingdom and discuss your power.

12 To show people his powerful works and the splendid beauty of his kingdom.

13 Your kingdom lasts forever, and your rule continues through all time.

14 God supports all who fall and lifts up all who are bent over.

15 Everyone looks to you, and you give them their food at the right time.

16 You open your hand and satisfy the needs of every living creature.

17 God is fair in all he does, and good in all his actions.

18 God is close to everyone who calls on him, to all who call on him honestly.

19 He will fulfill the wishes of those who respect him; he will listen to their cries and save them.

20 God protects everyone who loves Him, but He will destroy all the wicked.

21 I will praise God with my words; may everyone honor his holy name always and forever.
