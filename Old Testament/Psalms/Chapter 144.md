1 God blesses me with strength, teaches my hands to fight, and my fingers for battle.

2 My goodness and my protector; my strong tower and my rescuer; my shield and the one I trust; who brings my people under my rule.

3 God, what is a person that you notice them, or a human being that you care for them?

4 People are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow.

5 Bend your heavens, God, and come down; touch the mountains, and they will smoke.

6 Send out lightning and make them run away; fire your arrows and wipe them out.

7 Reach down from above; free me and rescue me from deep waters, from the grip of foreigners.

8 They talk nonsense, and their right hand is used for lying.

9 I will sing a new song to you, God: on a harp and a ten-stringed instrument I will praise you.

10 He gives salvation to kings and saves his servant David from the deadly sword.

11 Save me and rescue me from foreigners whose words are meaningless and whose right hand is dishonest.

12 Let our sons be like strong, young plants; let our daughters be like elegant pillars shaped to decorate a palace.

13 Let our barns be full, supplying every kind of provision; let our sheep multiply by thousands and tens of thousands in our fields.

14 Let our oxen be strong for work; let there be no break-ins or escapes; let there be no complaining in our streets.

15 Happy are the people who are in such a situation; yes, happy are the people whose God is the Lord.
