1 How long will you forget me, God? Forever? How long will you hide your face from me?

2 How long will I make plans in my heart, feeling sad every day? How long will my enemy triumph over me?

3 Think about me and listen, God: keep my eyes open, so I don't fall into the sleep of death.

4 So my enemy won't say, "I have beaten him," and my foes won't celebrate when I am shaken.

5 I trust in your kindness; my heart is happy because you have saved me.

6 I will sing to God, because he has been very good to me.
