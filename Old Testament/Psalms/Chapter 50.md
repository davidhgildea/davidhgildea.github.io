1 The powerful God has spoken and called to the earth from where the sun rises to where it sets.

2 From Zion, the perfect place of beauty, God has shone forth.

3 God will come and will not be silent. A fire will burn before Him, and it will be very stormy around Him.

4 He will call to the skies above and the earth below to judge his people.

5 Bring together those who are devoted to me, those who have made a promise to me through sacrifice.

6 The skies will show how right and good He is, because God is the judge. Pause and think about that.

7 Listen, my people, and I will speak; Israel, listen, and I will witness against you: I am God, your God.

8 I will not scold you for your sacrifices or burnt offerings, which have always been before me.

9 I will not take any bulls from your house or goats from your pens.

10 Every animal in the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills belong to me.

11 I know all the birds of the mountains, and the wild animals of the fields are mine.

12 If I were hungry, I wouldn't tell you because the world is mine and everything in it.

13 Will I eat bull meat, or drink goat blood?

14 Give thanks to God; and keep your promises to the Most High.

15 Ask for my help when you have trouble: I will save you, and you will praise me.

16 God says to the wicked, "Why do you talk about my laws or say you follow my agreement?"

17 You hate advice and ignore what I say.

18 When you saw a thief, you agreed with him, and you joined in with adulterers.

19 You use your mouth for evil and your tongue tells lies.

20 You sit and talk against your brother; you spread lies about your own mother's son.

21 You have done these things, and I stayed quiet; you thought I was just like you: but I will correct you and show you clearly.

22 Think about this, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart, and no one will save you.

23 Whoever offers praise honors me, and those who live rightly will see God's salvation.
