1 God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.

2 God's tent is in Salem, and his home is in Zion.

3 There he broke the arrows, the shield, the sword, and the battle. Pause.

4 You are more splendid and wonderful than the mountains of prey.

5 The brave are ruined, they have slept their last sleep; and none of the strong found their strength.

6 When you scold, God of Jacob, both chariots and horses fall into a deep sleep.

7 You, yes you, are to be feared: and who can stand before you when you are angry?

8 You made your judgment heard from heaven; the earth was afraid and became quiet.

9 When God stood up to judge and to rescue all the gentle people on earth. Pause.

10 Human anger will end up praising you; you will hold back the rest of the anger.

11 Promise and give to God: everyone around Him should bring gifts to the one who should be respected.

12 He will end the power of rulers; he is fearsome to the kings of the world.
