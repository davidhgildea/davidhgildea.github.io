1 Praise God: because it is good to sing to our God; it is enjoyable; and praise looks good.

2 God builds up Jerusalem; he brings together Israel's scattered people.

3 He heals those with a broken heart, and wraps their wounds.

4 He counts the number of the stars; he calls each one by its name.

5 Our God is great and very powerful; his wisdom has no end.

6 God lifts up the humble; he throws the wicked down to the ground.

7 Sing to God with thanks; play the harp to praise our God.

8 God covers the sky with clouds, gets rain ready for the earth, and makes grass grow on the mountains.

9 He gives food to the animals and feeds the crying young ravens.

10 God does not enjoy the power of the horse; he does not like the strength of a person's legs.

11 God finds joy in those who respect him and in those who trust in his kindness.

12 Praise God, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion.

13 God has made your city gates strong; He has blessed your children inside your walls.

14 He brings peace to your land and gives you the best wheat.

15 He sends out his command to the earth: his message spreads very fast.

16 He gives snow like wool; he spreads the frost like ashes.

17 He throws his ice like small pieces: who can withstand his cold?

18 He sends out his word and melts them; he makes his wind blow, and the waters flow.

19 He shows his words to Jacob, his laws and decisions to Israel.

20 God has not treated any other nation like this; they have not understood his laws. Praise God.
