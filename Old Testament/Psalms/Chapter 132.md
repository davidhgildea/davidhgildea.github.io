1 God, remember David and all his hardships.

2 He promised to God and made a vow to the powerful God of Jacob.

3 I will not enter my home or go to my bed;

4 I will not let my eyes sleep or my eyelids close.

5 Until I find a place for God, a home for the powerful God of Jacob.

6 We heard about it in Ephratah and found it in the forest fields.

7 We will enter his tents: we will worship at his footrest.

8 Get up, God, and go to your resting place; you and the chest that shows your power.

9 May your priests wear goodness, and may your holy people yell happily.

10 For your servant David's sake, do not reject your chosen one.

11 God has truly promised David; he will not break his promise; I will put one of your descendants on your throne.

12 If your children follow my agreement and the lessons I give them, their children will rule on your throne forever.

13 God has chosen Zion; he wants it as his home.

14 This is where I will rest forever; I will live here because I want it.

15 I will greatly bless her food supply; I will fill her needy with bread.

16 I will dress her priests in salvation, and her holy people will loudly celebrate with joy.

17 I will make David's power grow there; I have set up a light for my chosen one.

18 I will cover his enemies with shame, but his own crown will thrive.
