1 Sing loudly to God, our strength; make happy sounds to the God of Jacob.

2 Sing a song, and bring the drum, the lovely harp with the zither.

3 Sound the trumpet at the new moon, at the set time, on our special festival day.

4 This was a rule for Israel, and a law from the God of Jacob.

5 He made this a law in Joseph to be a witness, when he traveled through Egypt, where I heard a language I did not understand.

6 I took the burden off his shoulder; his hands were freed from carrying heavy pots.

7 You called for help in trouble, and I saved you; I answered you from the thunder's hiding place; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Pause.

8 Listen, my people, and I will speak to you: Israel, if you listen to me;

9 You must not have any foreign gods; you should not bow down to any foreign gods.

10 I am your God who brought you out of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11 But my people did not listen to me; Israel did not want me.

12 So I let them follow their own desires, and they did what they thought was best.

13 I wish my people had listened to me and Israel had followed my paths!

14 I would quickly defeat their enemies and act against their opponents.

15 God's enemies should have surrendered to him, but their punishment will last forever.

16 He should have given them the best wheat to eat, and I should have satisfied you with honey from the rock.
