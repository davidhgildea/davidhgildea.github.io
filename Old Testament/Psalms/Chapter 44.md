1 We have heard, O God, our ancestors told us what you did in their time, long ago.

2 How you drove out nations with your hand, and settled them; how you troubled the people, and forced them out.

3 They did not take the land with their own swords, nor did their own strength save them. It was your hand, your strength, and the brightness of your face, because you favored them.

4 You are my King, God: order victory for Jacob.

5 With your help, we will defeat our enemies; with your name, we will walk over those who attack us.

6 I will not rely on my bow, nor will my sword rescue me.

7 You have saved us from our enemies and made those who hated us feel ashamed.

8 We proudly trust in God all day, and forever praise your name. Pause.

9 But you have rejected us, made us feel ashamed, and do not go with our armies.

10 You make us retreat from the enemy, and those who hate us take our belongings for themselves.

11 You have made us like sheep set for slaughter and have spread us among the nations.

12 You sell your people for nothing and do not gain any profit from their sale.

13 You make us a disgrace to our neighbors, an object of scorn and ridicule to those around us.

14 You make us a joke among the nations, a thing people shake their heads at.

15 I am always upset, and shame covers my face.

16 Because of those who insult and speak against God, and because of the enemy who seeks revenge.

17 All this has happened to us, but we have not forgotten you, and we have not broken your agreement.

18 Our heart has not turned away, nor have our steps left your path.

19 Even though you have crushed us in the dragon's lair and shrouded us in deep darkness.

20 If we've forgotten our God's name, or reached out to a foreign god;

21 Won't God find this out? He knows the heart's secrets.

22 Yes, because of you we are being killed all day long; we are considered as sheep to be killed.

23 Wake up, why are you sleeping, God? Get up, do not reject us forever.

24 Why do you hide your face and forget about our suffering and hardship?

25 We feel very low, like we're pressed down to the ground; we are as close to the earth as if our stomach sticks to it.

26 Get up to help us, and save us because of your kindness.
