1 God hears you in times of trouble; may the God of Jacob protect you.

2 May God send you help from his holy place and give you support from Zion.

3 Remember all your gifts, and accept your burnt offering.

4 Give you what your heart wants and make all your plans succeed.

5 We will be happy because of your rescue, and we will raise our flags in the name of our God: may God answer all your requests.

6 Now I know that God saves the one he has chosen; he will listen to him from his holy place in heaven with the powerful help of his right hand.

7 Some rely on chariots, and some on horses, but we will trust in the name of our God.

8 They have fallen, but we have risen and stand tall.

9 Save us, God: may the king listen to us when we call.
