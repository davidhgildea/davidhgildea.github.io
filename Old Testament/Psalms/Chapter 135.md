1 Praise God. Praise the name of God; praise him, all you servants of God.

2 You who stand in God's house, in the courts of our God's house.

3 Praise God because God is good. Sing praises to His name because it is nice.

4 God has chosen Jacob for himself, and Israel as his special treasure.

5 I know that God is great and that our Lord is greater than all other gods.

6 Whatever God wanted to do, he did in heaven and on earth, in the seas and in all deep places.

7 God makes the mist rise from the earth's edges; he creates lightning for the rain; he brings the wind from his storerooms.

8 Who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both of humans and animals.

9 God sent signs and miracles into the middle of Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

10 God defeated large nations and killed powerful kings.

11 Sihon, the king of the Amorites, Og, the king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan.

12 God gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel.

13 Your name, O God, lasts forever; and people will remember you, O God, through all generations.

14 God will judge his people, and he will change his mind about his servants.

15 The gods of other nations are made of silver and gold and are crafted by human hands.

16 They have mouths but do not talk; they have eyes but do not see;

17 They have ears, but they don't hear; they also don't breathe through their mouths.

18 Those who make idols become like them; so does everyone who trusts in them.

19 Praise God, O people of Israel; praise God, O family of Aaron.

20 Praise God, O family of Levi: all who respect God, praise God.

21 May God, who lives in Jerusalem, be blessed. Praise God.
