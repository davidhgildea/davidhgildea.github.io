1 God is my shepherd; I will not lack anything.

2 God lets me rest in green fields; he guides me by calm waters.

3 He renews my strength. He guides me in the right paths, honoring his name.

4 Even when I go through the darkest path, I'm not scared of anything bad because you are with me, and your stick and cane make me feel safe.

5 You prepare a meal for me in front of my enemies; you put oil on my head; my cup is very full.

6 Goodness and kindness will be with me every day of my life, and I will live in God's house forever.
