1 God reigns, He is majestic; God is strong and clothes Himself with power: the world is set firm and cannot be shaken.

2 Your throne was set up long ago; you are eternal.

3 The waters have risen, God, the waters have risen and shouted; the waters rise and their waves crash.

4 God above is stronger than the sound of many waters, yes, even the powerful waves of the sea.

5 Your teachings are very trustworthy: your house should always be holy, God.
