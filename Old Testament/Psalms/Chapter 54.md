1 God, save me because of your name and decide about me with your power.

2 Listen to my prayer, God; pay attention to what I say.

3 Foreigners have attacked me, and bullies chase my life; they do not consider God. Pause.

4 Look, God helps me; God supports those who keep me safe.

5 God will pay back my enemies with evil and destroy them because you are truthful.

6 I will gladly offer sacrifices to you: I will praise your name, God, because it is good.

7 God has saved me from all my troubles, and I have seen my enemies get what they deserved.
