1 From the deep places, I have called out to you, God.

2 God, listen to my voice; pay attention to my pleading.

3 If you, God, kept a record of sins, who could stand?

4 You are forgiving, God, so we can respect you.

5 I wait for God, my soul waits, and I hope in his word.

6 My soul waits for God more than those who wait for the morning; I say, more than those who wait for the morning.

7 Let Israel hope in God: for with God there is mercy, and with him is abundant redemption.

8 He will save Israel from all their sins.
