1 God, be kind to us and bless us; let his face shine on us. Pause.

2 So that your path can be known on Earth, your salvation among all the nations.

3 Let the people thank you, God; let everyone thank you.

4 Let the countries be happy and sing with joy: because you will judge the people fairly and lead the countries on earth. Pause and think about that.

5 God, let the people praise you; let everyone praise you.

6 Then the earth will give its crops, and God, our God, will bless us.

7 God will bless us, and everyone on earth will respect him.
