</div>
1 Whoever lives in the hidden place of the Most High will stay safe under the protection of the Almighty.

2 I will say about God, He is my safe place and strong shelter: my God; in Him I will trust.

3 God will surely save you from the hunter's trap and from deadly disease.

4 God will protect you like a bird covers its young with feathers; you will find safety under his wings: his faithfulness will be your defense and protector.

5 Do not be afraid of dangers at night or arrows that fly during the day.

6 Not for the sickness that moves in the dark; not for the ruin that destroys at midday.

7 A thousand will fall near you, and ten thousand by your side, but it will not come close to you.

8 You will only watch and see what happens to the wicked.

9 Because you have made God, who is my protection, even the highest place, your home.

10 No harm will happen to you, nor will any sickness come close to your home.

11 God will send his angels to look after you and guard you wherever you go.

12 They will carry you in their hands, so you won't hurt your foot on a stone.

13 You will walk on the lion and snake; you will step on the young lion and the dragon.

14 Because he loves me, I will rescue him. I will protect him because he knows my name.

15 He will call to me, and I will reply; I will be with him in trouble, save him, and give him honor.

16 I will give him a long life and show him how I can save.
