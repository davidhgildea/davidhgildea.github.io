</div>
1 My God, my God, why have you left me alone? Why are you so far from saving me and from hearing my cries?

2 God, I call out for help during the day, but you do not hear me; and at night, I don't stay quiet.

3 But you are holy, O you who are praised by Israel.

4 Our ancestors trusted in you; they trusted, and you rescued them.

5 They called to you and were saved; they trusted in you and were not disappointed.

6 I am like a worm, not a man; scorned by everyone and looked down on by people.

7 Everyone who sees me mocks me; they sneer and shake their heads, saying,

8 He trusted in God to rescue him; let God save him since he takes pleasure in him.

9 You are the one who brought me out of the womb; you made me feel safe as I nursed at my mother's breasts.

10 From birth I was placed in your care; you have been my God since my mother carried me.

11 Stay close to me, because trouble is near and no one is here to help.

12 Many strong bulls have surrounded me; powerful bulls of Bashan have encircled me.

13 They opened their mouths wide at me, like a hungry, roaring lion.

14 I am drained like water, and all my bones are disjointed; my heart is like melted wax within me.

15 My strength has dried up like a clay pot; my tongue sticks to my gums; and you have brought me to the edge of death.

16 Dogs surround me; a group of evil people has trapped me; they have pierced my hands and feet.

17 I can count all my bones; they just look and stare at me.

18 They divide my clothes among themselves and gamble for my outfit.

19 But don't be far from me, God; hurry to help me, my strength.

20 Save my life from the sword; rescue me from the dog's grip.

21 Rescue me from the lion's mouth; You have answered me from the wild oxen's horns.

22 I will tell my brothers your name; I will praise you among the people gathered together.

23 You who respect God, praise him; all of you from Jacob's family, honor him; and respect him, everyone from Israel's family.

24 God has not ignored or hated the suffering of the suffering person; He did not turn away from him, but when he called for help, God listened.

25 I will praise you in a large gathering and fulfill my promises in front of those who respect God.

26 Humble people will eat and be happy; they who look for God will praise him; your heart will live forever.

27 People everywhere will remember and turn to God; all families of nations will worship before you.

28 The kingdom belongs to God, and he rules over the nations.

29 Everyone who is wealthy on earth will eat and worship; those who die will kneel before God, and no one can save their own life.

30 A child will serve God; they will be known as God's people for generations.

31 They will come and tell a future generation about God's goodness, because he has done this.
