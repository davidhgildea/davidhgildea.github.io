1 God, judge me and fight for me against a nation without godliness; save me from the lying and unfair person.

2 You are the God of my strength; why have you rejected me? Why must I go around sad because my enemies are oppressing me?

3 God, send out your light and your truth to guide me; may they lead me to your holy mountain and to the places where you live.

4 Then I will go to God's altar, to God who is my great joy; and with the harp, I will praise you, O my God.

5 Why are you sad, my soul? And why are you troubled inside me? Put your hope in God: for I will still praise him, who makes me well, and is my God.
