1 Those who trust in God will be like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved and stands forever.

2 God is always around his people like mountains surround Jerusalem.

3 The wicked's stick won't stay on the good people's land, so the good don't start doing wrong.

4 God, be kind to those who are good and to those who are honest in their hearts.

5 Those who choose wrong paths, God will guide with the wrongdoers, but peace will be with Israel.
