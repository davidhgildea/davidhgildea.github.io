1 God stands in the gathering of the powerful; he judges among the leaders.

2 How long will you make unfair decisions and favor the wrong people? Pause and think.

3 Protect the poor and children without parents; treat the troubled and poor fairly.

4 Help the poor and those in need; rescue them from the power of the wicked.

5 They do not know or understand; they continue in darkness: all the world's foundations are unsettled.

6 I have said, you are gods; and you are all children of the most High.

7 You will die like humans and fall like any leader.

8 Get up, God, and judge the world, because you will receive all the nations as your own.
