1 I look up to you, God in the heavens.

2 Just like servants watch their masters' hands, and a girl watches her mistress' hand, we watch for God until He shows us kindness.

3 God, have mercy on us, have mercy on us; we are very much filled with scorn.

4 Our soul is deeply filled with scorn from those who are at peace and with the contempt of the proud.
