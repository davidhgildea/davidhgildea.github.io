1 I will sing about love and fairness to you, O God, I will sing.

2 I will act wisely in a good way. Oh, when will you come to me? I will live in my house with a pure heart.

3 I will not look at evil things; I hate the actions of those who stray; they will not stick to me.

4 I will stay away from deceitful people; I will not associate with the wicked.

5 Anyone who secretly talks badly about their neighbor, I will remove; I will not tolerate anyone with arrogant eyes and a proud heart.

6 I will watch over the loyal people of the land, so they can live with me; anyone who lives a blameless life will serve me.

7 Anyone who cheats will not live in my house; a liar will not stay near me.

8 I will quickly get rid of all the bad people in the land to remove all those who do evil from God's city.
