1 I will look up to the hills, where my help comes from.

2 My help comes from God, who made heaven and earth.

3 God won't let your foot slip; he who watches over you won't fall asleep.

4 Look, the one who protects Israel will not get sleepy or fall asleep.

5 God is your protector; God is your shade at your right side.

6 The sun won't hurt you during the day, nor the moon at night.

7 God will protect you from all harm; He will keep your life safe.

8 God will protect you when you leave and when you return, now and always.
