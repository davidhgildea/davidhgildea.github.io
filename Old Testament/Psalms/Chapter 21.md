1 The king will be happy because of your power, God; he will be very glad because you save him!

2 You have granted him what his heart wanted, and you have not denied what he asked with his lips. Pause.

3 You go before him with good blessings; you place a crown of pure gold on his head.

4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him, a long life that lasts forever and ever.

5 God's glory is great because of your saving help: you have given him honor and greatness.

6 You have made him forever blessed; you have filled him with joy by your presence.

7 The king trusts in God, and with the kindness of the Most High, he will not be shaken.

8 Your hand will discover all your enemies: your strong hand will find those who hate you.

9 You will make them like a blazing furnace when you are angry: God will consume them in his fury, and the fire will eat them up.

10 You will destroy their fruit from the earth and their offspring among people.

11 They planned to harm you: they thought of a wicked plan, which they cannot carry out.

12 So you will make them run away when you prepare to shoot your arrows at them.

13 Let yourself be lifted up, God, by your own power; then we will sing and praise your strength.
