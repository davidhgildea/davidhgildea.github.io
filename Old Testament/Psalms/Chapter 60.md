1 God, you have rejected us, scattered us, and been unhappy with us; please come back to us.

2 You have made the earth shake; you have split it open: repair its cracks, for it is quaking.

3 You have shown your people tough times; you have made us drink the wine of confusion.

4 You have given a flag to those who respect you, so it can be shown because of the truth. Pause.

5 Let your loved one be rescued; save them with your power and listen to me.

6 God spoke in his holy place; I will be glad, I will split Shechem, and share out the Succoth valley.

7 Gilead belongs to me, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my strong head; Judah makes my laws.

8 Moab is like my washbasin; I will throw my shoe over Edom; Philistia, celebrate because of me.

9 Who will take me into the fortified city? Who will guide me into Edom?

10 Won't you, God, who rejected us before, and you, God, who did not go with our armies?

11 Help us in trouble, for human help is useless.

12 With God's help, we will act bravely because he will defeat our enemies.
