1 Have mercy on me, God, have mercy on me, for my soul trusts in you; yes, under the protection of your wings I will find shelter until these disasters have passed.

2 I will call out to God above all; to God who does everything for me.

3 God will send help from heaven to save me from my enemies' insults. God will show his kindness and truth.

4 My soul is with lions; I'm surrounded by people burning with anger, men whose teeth are like spears and arrows, and whose tongues are as sharp as swords.

5 God, be honored high above the skies; let your greatness be over the whole earth.

6 They set a trap for me; I am deeply troubled. They dug a hole in my path, but they have fallen into it themselves. Pause.

7 My heart is steady, God, my heart is steady; I will sing and praise you.

8 Wake up, my honor; wake up, stringed instruments and harp: I will wake up early.

9 I will praise you, God, among the people; I will sing to you among the nations.

10 Your kindness reaches to the sky, and your truth goes up to the clouds.

11 God, be lifted high above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
