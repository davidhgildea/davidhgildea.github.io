1 I will praise you, God, with all my heart; I will tell everyone about your amazing deeds.

2 I will be happy and celebrate in you; I will sing praises to your name, O Most High.

3 When my enemies turn back, they will stumble and die in your presence.

4 You have supported my right and my cause; you sat on the throne making fair judgments.

5 You have scolded the nations, you have destroyed the wicked, you have erased their name forever and ever.

6 Enemy, your destructions are finished forever: you have ruined cities; their remembrance is gone with them.

7 God will last forever; he has set up his throne for judging.

8 He will judge the world fairly and make just decisions for the people with honesty.

9 God will also be a safe place for the oppressed, a safe place in times of trouble.

10 Those who know your name will trust in you, God, because you have never abandoned those who look for you.

11 Sing praises to God, who lives in Zion; tell everyone about his actions.

12 When God looks into murders, he remembers the victims: he does not ignore the cries of the humble.

13 God, be kind to me. Look at the troubles I have from those who hate me, you who save me from near death.

14 I want to tell all your praise at the gates of Zion's city; I will be happy because you save me.

15 The nations have fallen into the pit they dug; their own feet are caught in the net they hid.

16 God is known by the justice He gives; the evil are caught by what they do. Reflect on this. Pause.

17 Evil people will go to a place of punishment, and so will every nation that forgets God.

18 The needy will not always be forgotten, and the hopes of the poor will never be lost.

19 Get up, God; don't let people win; judge the nations in your presence.

20 Make them afraid, God, so the nations will realize they are only human. Pause.
