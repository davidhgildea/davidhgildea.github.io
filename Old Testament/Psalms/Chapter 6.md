</div>
1 God, do not scold me in your anger or discipline me in your rage.

2 Be kind to me, God, because I am weak; God, heal me, for my bones are in pain.

3 I am deeply troubled; but God, how long will it be?

4 Come back, God, save my life; oh, rescue me because you are merciful.

5 When we die, we can't remember you; who will thank you from the grave?

6 I am tired from my sighing; all night I make my bed wet; I soak my couch with my tears.

7 My eye is worn out from sorrow; it grows weak because of all my enemies.

8 Leave me, all you who do wrong; for God has heard my crying.

9 God has heard my request; God will accept my prayer.

10 May all my enemies feel embarrassed and very upset; may they turn back and suddenly feel shame.
