1 Praise God. Praise God from the sky: praise him up high.

2 Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his armies.

3 Praise God, sun and moon; praise Him, all you shining stars.

4 Praise God, you highest heavens and the waters above the sky.

5 Let them praise God's name because when he gave the order, they were made.

6 God has set them up forever; He has given an order that will never end.

7 Praise God from the earth, you sea creatures, and all ocean depths.

8 Fire and hail, snow and clouds; stormy wind carrying out God's command:

9 Mountains and all hills; trees with fruit and all cedars.

10 Animals, all livestock; creatures that crawl, and birds that fly:

11 Earth's kings and everyone, leaders and all earth's judges:

12 Young people and girls; elderly people and children:

13 Let them praise God's name, for only His name is wonderful; His majesty is higher than earth and heaven.

14 He also lifts up the strength of his people, the honor of all his holy ones; even the children of Israel, a people close to him. Praise God.
