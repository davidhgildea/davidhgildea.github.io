1 Listen to my words, God, think about what I am silently praying.

2 Listen to my cry for help, my King and God, for I will pray to you.

3 You will hear my voice in the morning, God; in the morning, I will send my prayer to you and wait for your answer.

4 You are not a God who likes evil; wrongdoers cannot stay with you.

5 Fools cannot be near you; you dislike all who do wrong.

6 You will destroy those who tell lies: God will hate the violent and deceitful person.

7 But as for me, I will come into your house because of your great mercy; and I will worship you with respect, facing your holy temple.

8 Guide me, God, in your goodness because of my enemies; make your path clear to me.

9 They are not loyal; they are very bad inside; their throat is like an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.

10 God, destroy them; let them be ruined by their own plans; throw them out because of their many sins, for they have turned against you.

11 Let everyone who trusts in you be happy; let them always sing for joy, because you protect them. Let those who love your name be joyful in you.

12 God, you will bless good people; you will surround them with your favor as with a shield.
