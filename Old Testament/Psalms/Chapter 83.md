1 God, do not be silent; do not stay quiet, God.

2 Look, your enemies are causing chaos: and those who hate you have become arrogant.

3 They have made sneaky plans against your people and plotted against those you protect.

4 They said, "Come, let's destroy them as a nation, so no one remembers the name Israel anymore."

5 They have agreed together to join forces against you.

6 The tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines and the people of Tyre;

8 Assur has also teamed up with them; they have helped Lot's descendants. Pause.

9 Treat them like you did the Midianites and like you did Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.

10 They died at Endor and became like manure on the ground.

11 Make their leaders like Oreb and Zeeb; make all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna.

12 They said, "Let's take God's houses for ourselves."

13 My God, make them like a spinning wheel; like dry plants before the wind.

14 Just as fire burns wood, and flames set the mountains ablaze;

15 Chase them with your wind and scare them with your storm.

16 Make them feel ashamed so that they will look for you, God.

17 May they be confused and troubled forever; yes, may they be embarrassed and die.

18 People will know that you, named God, are the highest above all the earth.
