1 God, you are my God; I will look for you early. My soul is thirsty for you, my body longs for you in a dry and thirsty land with no water.

2 To see your power and your glory, just as I have seen you in the holy place.

3 Because your kindness is better than life, my lips will praise you.

4 I will bless you as long as I live; I will raise my hands in your name.

5 My soul will be happy as with the best food; and my mouth will joyfully praise you.

6 When I think of you on my bed and reflect on you during the night time.

7 Because you have helped me, I will be happy in your protection.

8 I follow you closely with all my heart; your strong hand supports me.

9 Those who try to destroy me will be brought down to the deepest parts of the earth.

10 They will die by the sword and become food for foxes.

11 The king will be happy in God; everyone who makes promises by him will be proud: but the mouths of liars will be shut.
