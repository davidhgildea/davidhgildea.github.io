1 Are you really talking fair, group of people? Are you judging honestly, you people?

2 Yes, in your hearts you plan evil; you think about the harm your hands can do in the world.

3 From birth, the wicked are lost; they go wrong from the start, telling lies.

4 Their poison is like snake venom; they are like the deaf cobra that covers its ears.

5 Who do not listen to the voice of snake charmers, no matter how clever their charms.

6 God, break their teeth in their mouths; smash the young lions' strong teeth.

7 Let them disappear like flowing water: when he aims his bow to fire his arrows, let them break apart.

8 Like a melting snail, let each of them vanish: like a stillborn baby, that they never see the sun.

9 Before your pots get hot from the thorns, God will sweep them away with a storm, alive and in his anger.

10 Good people will be happy when they see punishment; they will wash their feet in the blood of the bad people.

11 A person will say, "Surely there is a reward for good people; truly, God is the one who judges on earth."
