1 Praise God. Praise God, my soul.

2 As long as I live, I will praise God: I will sing to my God as long as I exist.

3 Do not trust in leaders or in any human who cannot save you.

4 When he stops breathing, he goes back to the ground; on that day his plans end.

5 The person who has the God of Jacob to help him and who hopes in God is happy.

6 God made the sky, the land, the sea, and everything in them; God always keeps promises.

7 God judges for the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. God sets the prisoners free.

8 God opens the eyes of the blind; God lifts up those who are bent over; God loves the good people.

9 God protects foreigners; He supports orphans and widows; but He makes the path of the wicked difficult.

10 God will rule forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise God.
