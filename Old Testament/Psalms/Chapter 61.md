1 Listen to my cry, God; pay attention to my prayer.

2 From the farthest part of the earth, I will call to you when I am feeling too weak: take me to the place that is stronger than I am.

3 You have been a safe place for me and a strong tower against the enemy.

4 I will live in your tent forever: I will find shelter under your wings. Pause.

5 God, you have heard my promises; you have given me the inheritance of those who respect your name.

6 You will extend the king's life, and his years will be like many generations.

7 He will live with God forever: please make ready kindness and honesty to protect him.

8 I will praise your name forever and keep my promises every day.
