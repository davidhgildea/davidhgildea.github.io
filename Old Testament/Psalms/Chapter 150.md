1 Praise God. Praise him in his holy place; praise him in the sky that shows his strength.

2 Praise God for his powerful deeds; praise him for his great majesty.

3 Praise God with the trumpet's sound; praise God with the psaltery and harp.

4 Praise God with drums and dancing; praise God with strings and pipes.

5 Praise God with loud cymbals; praise God with clashing cymbals.

6 Let everything that breathes praise God. Praise God.
