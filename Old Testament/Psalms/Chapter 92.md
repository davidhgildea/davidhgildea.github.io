1 It is good to give thanks to God and to sing praises to your name, O Most High.

2 To show your kindness in the morning, and your faithfulness every night.

3 Play music on a ten-stringed instrument, on the psaltery, and on the harp, with a majestic tune.

4 For you, God, have made me happy with what you have done; I will celebrate the things your hands have created.

5 God, how great are your works! Your thoughts are very deep.

6 A thoughtless person does not know; a fool does not understand this.

7 When the bad grow like grass, and all who do wrong thrive, it is so they can be destroyed forever.

8 But you, God, are the highest forever.

9 Look, your enemies, God, look, your enemies will die; all the doers of wrong will be spread out.

10 You will lift my strength like a wild ox's horn: I will be blessed with new oil.

11 I will see what I wish happen to my enemies, and I will hear what I wish for the wicked who oppose me.

12 Good people will thrive like palm trees; they will grow strong like cedar trees in Lebanon.

13 People planted in God's house will thrive in God's courtyards.

14 Even in old age, they will still produce fruit; they will stay healthy and strong.

15 To show that God is just: He is my strong support, and there is nothing unfair in Him.
