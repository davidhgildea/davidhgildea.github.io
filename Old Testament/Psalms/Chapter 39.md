</div>
1 I decided to watch how I act, so I won't sin with what I say; I will control my words when bad people are around me.

2 I stayed quiet, didn't even speak what's good; my sadness grew.

3 I felt a strong burning in my heart as I thought deeply; then I began to speak.

4 God, let me know my life's end and how many days I have; let me realize how short-lived I am.

5 Look, you have made my life very short, and my lifetime seems like nothing to you. Truly, even at his healthiest, every person is completely fleeting.

6 Everyone goes through life putting on a show for no reason; they worry for nothing. They pile up wealth, without knowing who will end up with it.

7 And now, God, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.

8 Save me from all my wrongdoings; don't let the foolish shame me.

9 I was silent, I did not open my mouth; because you did it.

10 Take away your punishment; I am worn out from your strong hand.

11 When you correct people for their wrongs with scolding, you cause their beauty to fade away like a moth: truly, all people are fleeting. Pause and think.

12 Listen to my prayer, God, and hear my cry; do not ignore my tears: for I am a stranger to you, and a traveler, just like my ancestors were.

13 Please give me rest so I can get strong again before I leave and disappear.
