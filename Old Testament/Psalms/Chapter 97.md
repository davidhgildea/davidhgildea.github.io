1 God rules; let the earth be happy; let the many islands be joyful.

2 Clouds and darkness surround God; fairness and justice are where his throne is.

3 A fire goes before him and burns up his enemies all around.

4 God's lightning lit up the world; the earth saw it and shook.

5 The hills melted like wax when God appeared, when the God of the whole earth came near.

6 The sky shows God's goodness, and everyone sees his greatness.

7 Let those who worship idols and are proud of their false gods be confused: let all gods bow down to Him.

8 Zion heard and was happy; the women of Judah were joyful because of your decisions, God.

9 For you, God, are higher than all the earth; you are lifted up far above all gods.

10 You who love God, hate evil; God protects his holy people and saves them from the wicked.

11 Light is given to the good, and joy to the honest in heart.

12 Be happy with God, you good people; and say thanks when you think of his goodness.
