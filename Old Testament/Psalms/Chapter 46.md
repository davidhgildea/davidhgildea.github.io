1 God is our safe place and power, always there to help in times of trouble.

2 So we won't be afraid, even if the earth is taken away, and even if the mountains are moved into the sea's center.

3 Even if the waters roar and churn, even if the mountains tremble with the water's surge, pause.

4 A river flows, its streams bring joy to God's city, the sacred home of the Most High.

5 God is with her; she will not fall: God will help her at the break of day.

6 Nations were angry, kingdoms shook; when God spoke, the earth dissolved.

7 God is with us; the God of Jacob is our safe place.

8 Come, see what God has done, how he has laid waste the earth.

9 God makes wars stop all over the world; He breaks the bow, snaps the spear, and burns the chariots in fire.

10 Stay calm and understand that I am God: I will be honored among the nations, I will be honored in the world.

11 God is with us; the God of Jacob is our safe place. Pause and think about that.
