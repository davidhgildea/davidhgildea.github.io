1 God, my heart is steady; I will sing and praise you with all my heart.

2 Wake up, stringed instruments and harp: I will wake up early.

3 I will praise you, God, among the people; and I will sing praises to you among the nations.

4 Your kindness is vast, beyond the skies, and your truth goes up to the clouds.

5 God, be lifted up higher than the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.

6 Help your loved ones be rescued: save them with your power, and respond to me.

7 God has spoken in his sacred place; I will be happy, I will split Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.

8 Gilead belongs to me; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my strong leader; Judah makes my laws.

9 Moab is my washbasin; I will toss my shoe over Edom; I will be victorious over Philistia.

10 Who will take me into the fortified city? Who will guide me into Edom?

11 Won't you, God, who have rejected us, come with our armies?

12 Help us in trouble, because human help is useless.

13 With God's help, we will be brave; He will defeat our enemies.
