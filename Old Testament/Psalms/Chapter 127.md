1 Unless God builds the house, those who work on it waste their effort; unless God protects the city, the guard stays awake for nothing.

2 It's useless to wake up early and go to bed late, working hard for a living; God gives rest to those he loves.

3 Children are a gift from God, and the babies born to us are his reward.

4 Like arrows in a strong person's hand are the children born in one's youth.

5 A happy person has many children. They won't be embarrassed but will talk to their enemies confidently.
