1 Praise is ready for you, God, in Zion; and the promise will be kept to you.

2 You who listen to prayer, everyone will come to you.

3 Sins overpower me; but you will forgive our wrongdoings.

4 Happy is the person you choose and bring close to you to live in your spaces; we will be happy with the goodness of your home, your holy place.

5 With amazing acts of justice, you respond to us, God who saves us; you are the trust of everyone on earth, even those far away on the sea.

6 God makes the mountains strong with his power.

7 God calms the sea's roar, the waves' noise, and the uproar of the people.

8 People living in the farthest places fear your signs; you make the sunrise and sunset bring joy.

9 You care for the earth and give it water; you make it very fertile with the river of God that is always full of water. You provide crops for the people, for you have made the earth ready.

10 You water the land deeply; you level its furrows; you soften it with rain; you bless its crops.

11 You bless the year with your goodness, and your paths overflow with richness.

12 Rain falls on the wild fields, and the small hills are happy all around.

13 Fields are filled with herds; valleys are blanketed with grain. They cheer and sing.
