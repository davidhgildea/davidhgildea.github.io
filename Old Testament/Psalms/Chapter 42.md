1 Like a deer that longs for streams of water, my soul longs for you, God.

2 I long for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?

3 I cry all day and night, and people keep asking me, "Where is your God?"

4 When I think about these things, I share all my feelings: because I used to go with the crowd, I joined them to worship at God's house, with happy and thankful shouting, with many who were celebrating.

5 Why are you sad, my soul? And why are you troubled inside me? Put your hope in God: because I will still praise him for his support.

6 My God, I am deeply sad inside me; so I will think of you from the area of the Jordan River, near the Hermon mountains and Mount Mizar.

7 The deep waters call to the deep at the sound of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.

8 God will show his kindness during the day, and at night I will sing a song about him and pray to the God who gives me life.

9 I will ask God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk in sadness because the enemy is crushing me?"

10 It's like there's a sword in my bones; my enemies mock me, constantly asking, "Where is your God?"

11 Why are you sad, my soul? And why are you upset inside me? Put your hope in God: because I will still praise him, who is the one who makes me well, and my God.
