1 In you, God, I place my trust: may I never be confused.

2 Save me by your goodness, and help me escape. Listen to me and rescue me.

3 Be my strong home where I can always go; you ordered my rescue because you are my rock and my safe place.

4 Save me, my God, from the wicked, from the unjust and cruel person.

5 You are my hope, God; you have been my trust since I was young.

6 You have supported me since birth; you brought me out of my mother's body: I will always praise you.

7 I am a surprise to many; but you are my strong shelter.

8 May my mouth always be full of your praise and honor.

9 Don't reject me when I get old; don't leave me when my strength is gone.

10 My enemies talk about me; and those who want to hurt me plan together.

11 They say, "God has left him: chase him and catch him, for no one will save him."

12 God, don't be far from me; God, hurry to help me.

13 Let those who are against me be confused and destroyed; let those who want to harm me be covered with shame and disgrace.

14 I will always have hope and will praise you more and more.

15 I will always talk about your goodness and your help, because I can't count them.

16 I will go with God's strength; I will talk about your righteousness, yours alone.

17 God, you have taught me since I was young, and until now I have told of your wonderful deeds.

18 Even now when I am old and have gray hair, God, do not leave me alone until I have told this generation about your strength and shown all those yet to come your power.

19 Your goodness, O God, is so great, you have done amazing things: O God, there is no one like you!

20 You, who have shown me great and hard troubles, will make me live again, and will lift me up from the deep places of the earth.

21 You will make me greater and give me comfort on all sides.

22 I will praise you with the lyre for your faithfulness, my God; I will sing to you with the harp, Holy One of Israel.

23 I will be very happy as I sing to you; my soul, which you have saved, will rejoice.

24 My tongue will speak of your goodness all day long because those who want to harm me are confused and ashamed.
