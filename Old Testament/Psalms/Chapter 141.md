1 God, I call to you: hurry to me; listen to my voice when I call to you.

2 Let my prayer come to you like incense, and the raising of my hands like the evening offering.

3 God, guard what I say; protect what I speak.

4 Don't let my heart turn to evil things, to do bad deeds with people who do wrong; and don't let me enjoy their tasty foods.

5 Let a good person correct me; it will be a kindness. Let them tell me when Iâ€™m wrong; it will be like fine oil on my head. And I will still pray for them when they are in trouble.

6 When their leaders fall on rocky ground, they will listen to my words; for they are pleasant.

7 Our bones are spread out at the edge of the grave, like wood chopped and split on the ground.

8 I look to you, God: I trust in you; do not let my soul be left without help.

9 Protect me from the traps set by others and the tricks of those who do wrong.

10 Let the wicked get caught in their own traps, while I get away safely.
