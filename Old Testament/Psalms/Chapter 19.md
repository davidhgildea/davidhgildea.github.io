1 The skies show God's greatness; and the sky displays what his hands have made.

2 Every day speaks, and every night teaches knowledge.

3 Every language and speech can hear their voice.

4 Their message has spread all over the world, and their words reach the ends of the earth. God has made a home in the sky for the sun.

5 It is like a groom coming out of his room, happy like a runner ready to race.

6 He comes from the farthest part of the sky, moves in a circle to the ends, and nothing can hide from its heat.

7 God's law is perfect and refreshes the soul. God's promises are trustworthy, giving wisdom to the simple.

8 God's laws are fair, making the heart glad; God's rule is clear, giving light to the eyes.

9 Respecting God is pure, lasting forever; God's decisions are completely true and fair.

10 They are more valuable than gold, even a lot of pure gold; they are also sweeter than honey, even honey from the comb.

11 Your teachings warn your servant, and great reward comes from following them.

12 Who can know their own mistakes? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.

13 Help me avoid sins done in pride; don't let them control me. Then I will be blameless and free from serious guilt.

14 May the words I speak and the thoughts in my heart please you, God, my strength and my savior.
