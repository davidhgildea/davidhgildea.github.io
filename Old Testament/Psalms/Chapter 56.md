1 God, be kind to me because people want to defeat me; they fight and press me down every day.

2 My enemies want to defeat me every day; there are many who attack me, O God.

3 When I am scared, I will trust you.

4 I will praise God for his word; I trust in God and will not be afraid of what people can do to me.

5 Every day they twist what I say; all they think about is how to harm me.

6 They come together, they hide, they watch every move I make, waiting to take my life.

7 Can they avoid punishment through wrongdoing? In your anger, bring down the people, God.

8 You know about my wandering. Collect my tears in your bottle. Aren't they listed in your book?

9 When I call out to you, my enemies will turn away; I know this because God supports me.

10 I will praise God for his word; I will praise him for his promises.

11 I trust in God: I won't be afraid of what people can do to me.

12 I am bound by my promises to you, God; I will give you praise.

13 You have saved my life from death; won't you keep my feet from tripping, so I can walk before God in the light where people live?
