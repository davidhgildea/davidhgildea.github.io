1 God, you have been good to your land; you have freed Jacob's captives.

2 You have forgiven your people's sins; you have covered all their wrongs. Pause and think about that.

3 You have removed all your anger; you have turned away from the intensity of your rage.

4 God of our salvation, turn us back to you and stop being angry with us.

5 Will you stay angry with us forever? Will you keep your anger through all generations?

6 Will you not bring us back to life so your people can be happy in you?

7 Show us your mercy, God, and give us your salvation.

8 I will listen to what God will say: He promises peace to His people and His holy ones, but they must not go back to foolish ways.

9 God's rescue is close to those who respect him; so that honor may live in our land.

10 Kindness and truth have come together; fairness and peace have embraced.

11 Truth will grow from the ground; and fairness will look down from the sky.

12 Yes, God will give what is good, and our land will produce its crops.

13 Goodness will lead the way for him; and will guide us on his path.
