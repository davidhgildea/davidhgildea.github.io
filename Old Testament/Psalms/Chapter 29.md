1 Give to God, you powerful ones, give God glory and power.

2 Give God the honor that belongs to His name; worship God in the beauty of being holy.

3 God's voice is over the waters; the glorious God thunders; God is over the vast waters.

4 God's voice is strong; God's voice is majestic.

5 God's voice breaks the cedars; yes, God breaks the cedars of Lebanon.

6 He makes them leap like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.

7 God's voice splits the flames of fire.

8 God's voice shakes the desert; God shakes the Kadesh desert.

9 God's voice makes the deer give birth and uncovers the forests; in his temple, everyone talks about his greatness.

10 God sits above the flood; yes, God reigns as King forever.

11 God will give his people strength; God will bless his people with peace.
