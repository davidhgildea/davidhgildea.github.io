1 When Israel left Egypt, Jacob's family left a nation with a different language.

2 Judah was his holy place, and Israel was under his rule.

3 The sea saw it and ran away; the Jordan River turned back.

4 The mountains jumped like rams, and the small hills like young sheep.

5 What was wrong with you, O sea, that you ran away? O Jordan, why did you turn back?

6 You mountains, that jumped like rams; and you small hills, like lambs?

7 Shake, earth, at the presence of God, at the presence of the God of Jacob.

8 God turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a flowing spring.
