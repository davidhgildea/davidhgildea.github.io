1 Praise God. Sing to God a new song, and praise Him when the faithful gather together.

2 Let Israel be happy with their creator; let Zion's children be joyful in their King.

3 Let them praise his name with dancing and sing to him with tambourine and harp.

4 God enjoys his people; he will honor the humble with salvation.

5 Let God's holy people be happy and praise Him; let them sing loudly on their beds.

6 Let them speak God's high praises and hold a double-edged sword in their hand.

7 To carry out revenge on the nations and punishment on the peoples.

8 To tie up their kings with chains, and their leaders with iron shackles.

9 To carry out the written judgment on them: all God's saints have this honor. Praise God.
