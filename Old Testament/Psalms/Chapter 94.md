1 God, who owns revenge, show yourself.

2 Rise up, you judge of the earth: give the proud what they deserve.

3 God, how long will the wicked win?

4 How long will they keep on speaking harsh words and all the wrongdoers brag about themselves?

5 They crush your people, God, and harm your cherished ones.

6 They kill the widow and the foreigner, and they murder the orphan.

7 They say, God won't see, and the God of Jacob won't pay attention.

8 Listen, you senseless people: and you fools, when will you become wise?

9 The one who made the ear, can't he hear? The one who created the eye, can't he see?

10 The one who punishes nations, won't he correct? The one who teaches people knowledge, won't he know?

11 God knows what people think, and that it is meaningless.

12 Happy is the person you correct, God, and teach from your law.

13 So you can give him peace from hard times until a trap is made for the evil.

14 God will not reject His people or abandon His inheritance.

15 Justice will come back to what is right, and all the honest-hearted will support it.

16 Who will stand up for me against those who do evil? Or who will stand up for me against those who commit wrongs?

17 If God hadn't helped me, I would have been very close to complete silence.

18 When I said, "I'm slipping," your kindness, God, supported me.

19 When I have many worries, your comforts make my soul happy.

20 Can a throne of evil be your partner, making trouble through its laws?

21 They join together against the good person and blame the innocent.

22 God is my protector, and He is the strong rock where I am safe.

23 He will make them suffer for their sins and will completely destroy them because of their evil; yes, our God will wipe them out.
