1 They have troubled me often since I was young, let Israel say now.

2 They have troubled me often since I was young, but they have not beaten me.

3 People plowed on my back; they made their cuts long.

4 God is good: he has broken the ropes of the evil ones.

5 Let all who hate Zion be confused and driven away.

6 Let them be like the grass on the rooftops, which dries up before it can grow.

7 The mower doesn't fill his hand, nor does the one who ties bundles fill his arms.

8 Those who pass by don't say, "God's blessing be on you; we bless you in God's name."
