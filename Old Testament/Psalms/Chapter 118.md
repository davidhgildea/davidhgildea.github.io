1 Give thanks to God; for he is good: his kindness lasts forever.

2 Let Israel say now, God's kindness lasts forever.

3 Let Aaron's family now say, God's kindness lasts forever.

4 Let those who respect God say, his kindness lasts forever.

5 I called to God when I was in trouble; God answered me and put me in a spacious place.

6 God is with me; I will not be afraid: what can anyone do to me?

7 God supports me along with those who help me; therefore, I will see my wishes fulfilled against those who hate me.

8 It is better to trust in God than to rely on people.

9 It is better to trust in God than to rely on leaders.

10 All countries surrounded me, but with God's help, I will defeat them.

11 They surrounded me; yes, they surrounded me: but in God's name, I will defeat them.

12 They surrounded me like bees; they were put out like a thorn fire: because in the name of God I will defeat them.

13 You pushed me hard to make me fall, but God helped me.

14 God is my strength and song, and has become my salvation.

15 People are celebrating and being saved in the homes of the good; God's powerful hand does great things.

16 God's right hand is lifted high; God's right hand does mighty things.

17 I will not die, but live, and tell of what God has done.

18 God has punished me a lot, but he hasn't let me die.

19 Open the right way for me: I will enter and thank God.

20 This gate belongs to God, and the good people will go in through it.

21 I will praise you because you have heard me and have become my salvation.

22 The stone that the builders rejected has become the most important cornerstone.

23 This is what God has done; it is wonderful to us.

24 This is the day that God has made; we will celebrate and be happy in it.

25 Please save us now, I ask you, God; God, I ask you, bring us success now.

26 Happy is the one who comes in God's name: we have given you blessings from God's house.

27 God is Lord, who has given us light; tie the offering with ropes, all the way to the altar's corners.

28 You are my God, and I will praise you; you are my God, I will lift you up.

29 Give thanks to God, for he is good; his kindness lasts forever.
