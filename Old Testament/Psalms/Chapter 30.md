1 I will praise you, God, because you have lifted me up and have not let my enemies be happy about my troubles.

2 God, I called out to you and you healed me.

3 God, you have lifted my soul from the grave; you have kept me alive so I wouldn't fall into the pit.

4 Sing to God, all his holy people, and thank him when you remember his goodness.

5 God's anger lasts only a moment, but his favor brings life; though sadness lasts through the night, happiness comes with the morning.

6 When I was doing well, I thought I would always be secure.

7 God, because of your kindness, you made my position strong: when you turned away, I was upset.

8 I cried to you, God; and to God I pleaded for help.

9 What good comes from my death if I go down to the grave? Can dust praise you or tell of your truth?

10 Listen, God, and show me kindness; God, be my helper.

11 You have changed my sadness into dancing; you took away my mourning clothes and dressed me with joy.

12 So I can sing about your greatness and always praise you. God, I will thank you forever.
