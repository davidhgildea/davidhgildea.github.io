1 God is great, and deserves high praise in the city of our God, on his holy mountain.

2 Mount Zion is beautifully placed, the joy of the entire world, on the north side, the city of the great King.

3 God is known in her strong buildings as a place of safety.

4 Look, the kings gathered and went by together.

5 They saw it and were amazed; they were distressed and hurried away.

6 They were very afraid and in pain like a woman giving birth.

7 You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

8 We have heard and now we see in the city of God, the city of our God: God will make it last forever. Pause and think about that.

9 We have thought of your kindness, God, in the middle of your temple.

10 God, your name reaches to the ends of the earth, just like your praise; your right hand is filled with fairness.

11 Let Mount Zion be happy, let Judah's daughters be joyful, because of your decisions.

12 Walk around Zion, circle it, and count its towers.

13 Pay close attention to her strong walls, look carefully at her palaces; so you can tell the next generation about them.

14 This God is our God forever: He will guide us until we die.
