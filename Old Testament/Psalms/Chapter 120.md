1 When I was in trouble, I called out to God, and he listened to me.

2 God, save me from lies and a tricky tongue.

3 What will you get? What will happen to you, you lying tongue?

4 Strong arrows of the powerful, with burning coals.

5 I am sad because I live in Mesech and stay in the tents of Kedar.

6 My soul has lived a long time with someone who hates peace.

7 I want peace, but when I talk, they want war.
