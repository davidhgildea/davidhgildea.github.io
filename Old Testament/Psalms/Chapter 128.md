1 Happy is everyone who respects God and follows His paths.

2 You will enjoy the work of your hands: you will be happy, and things will go well for you.

3 Your wife will be like a vine full of fruit next to your house; your children will be like young olive trees around your table.

4 See, this is how the man who respects God will be blessed.

5 God will bless you from Zion; and you will enjoy Jerusalem's goodness all your life.

6 Yes, you will see your grandchildren, and there will be peace in Israel.
