1 I love God, because he has heard my voice and my pleas.

2 Because he listened to me, I will call on him as long as I live.

3 Death's sorrows surrounded me, and hell's pains grabbed me: I encountered trouble and sadness.

4 I called out to God, "Please, God, save me."

5 God is kind and fair; yes, our God is compassionate.

6 God protects the uncomplicated; I was down, and he aided me.

7 Come back to your peace, my soul; because God has been very good to you.

8 You have saved my life from death, my eyes from crying, and my feet from tripping.

9 I will live a good life before God among the living.

10 I believed, so I spoke: I was very troubled.

11 I quickly said, "Everyone lies."

12 How can I repay God for all the good things he has done for me?

13 I will take the cup of rescue and call on the name of God.

14 I will keep my promises to God now in front of all his people.

15 God values the death of his faithful ones greatly.

16 God, truly I am your servant; I am your servant and the son of your female servant: you have set me free from my chains.

17 I will give you a sacrifice of thanks and call on the name of God.

18 I will keep my promises to God now in front of all his people.

19 In the courtyards of God's house, in the center of you, Jerusalem, praise God.
