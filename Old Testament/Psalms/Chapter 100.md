1 Make a happy sound for God, all you places.

2 Serve God with happiness; come into his presence with singing.

3 Understand that God is God: He made us, we didn't make ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His field.

4 Go into God's gates with thanks, and into His yards with praise: be thankful to Him, and speak well of His name.

5 God is good; his kindness lasts forever; and his truth remains for all generations.
