1 Sing a new song to God; let everyone on earth sing to God.

2 Sing to God, praise His name; show His salvation every day.

3 Tell everyone about God's greatness and the amazing things he does for all people.

4 God is great and deserves much praise; we should respect Him more than all other gods.

5 All the gods of other nations are just idols, but God created the skies.

6 Honor and greatness are in front of him; power and beauty are in his holy place.

7 Give to God, all families of the people, give to God glory and strength.

8 Give God the honor that fits his name; bring a gift and enter his courts.

9 Worship God in the beauty of being holy; let all the earth respect him.

10 Tell the nations that God rules: the earth is firm and cannot be shaken; he will judge everyone fairly.

11 Let the sky be happy, and the earth be joyful; let the sea and everything in it make loud sounds.

12 Let the field be happy, and everything in it; then all the trees of the forest will celebrate.

13 Before God, for he comes to judge the earth: he will judge the world fairly and the people with truth.
