1 Judge me, God; for I have lived with honesty. I have also trusted in God; so I will not fall.

2 Check me, God, and test me; see what I really want and what's in my heart.

3 Your kindness is always in my sight, and I live by your truth.

4 I haven't spent time with worthless people, nor will I join those who pretend to be what they are not.

5 I hate the group of wrongdoers and will not sit with the wicked.

6 I will wash my hands to show I am innocent and come close to your altar, God.

7 So I can speak out with thanks and tell everyone about your amazing deeds.

8 God, I love your house's living place, and where your honor stays.

9 Don't group me with sinners, or my life with violent people.

10 They do wrong with their hands, and their right hand is full of bribes.

11 But as for me, I will live with honesty: save me and show me mercy.

12 My foot stands on level ground; in the gatherings, I will bless God.
