</div>
1 God, foreigners have entered your land; they have made your holy temple dirty; they have turned Jerusalem into ruins.

2 They gave your servants' dead bodies as food to the birds of the sky, and your holy people's flesh to the earth's animals.

3 They poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and no one was there to bury them.

4 We have become a disgrace to our neighbors, mocked and laughed at by those around us.

5 How long, God? Will you be angry always? Will your jealousy burn like fire?

6 Show your anger to the nations that don't know you, and to the kingdoms that don't call on your name.

7 They have destroyed Jacob and ruined his home.

8 God, don't remember our past sins. Quickly show us your compassion, because we are very weak.

9 Help us, God who saves us, for the sake of your name's glory; rescue us and take away our sins for your name's sake.

10 Why should other nations ask, "Where is their God?" Let it be known to these nations that you avenge the spilled blood of your servants.

11 Let the groans of the captive reach you; save those sentenced to die by your great power.

12 Give back to our neighbors seven times the insults they have given you, God.

13 We, your people and sheep of your pasture, will always thank you; we will praise you for all generations.
