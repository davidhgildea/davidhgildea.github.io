1 We thank you, God, we give you thanks, because your name is close and your amazing deeds show it.

2 When I gather the people, I will judge fairly.

3 The earth and everyone living on it are falling apart; I support its foundations. Pause and think about that.

4 I told the foolish, "Don't act foolishly," and to the wicked, "Don't raise your power."

5 Don't raise your horn proudly; don't talk with arrogance.

6 Success doesn't come from the east, west, or south.

7 God is the judge: He brings down one and lifts up another.

8 In God's hand is a cup filled with strong red wine, mixed well; He pours it, and all the wicked on earth must drink its bitter remains.

9 I will always tell of God's deeds; I will sing praise to Jacob's God.

10 I will cut off all the power of the wicked, but the power of the good people will be lifted up.
