1 Look, it's good and nice when brothers live together in peace!

2 It is like fine oil on the head, flowing down onto the beard, even Aaron's beard, reaching down to the collar of his robes.

3 Like the dew from Mount Hermon or the dew on Zion's hills, there God gives the blessing of eternal life.
