1 My soul truly waits for God; my rescue comes from Him.

2 He alone is my rock and my savior; he protects me; I won't be shaken much.

3 How long will you plan harm against someone? You will all be killed: you will be like a leaning wall or a shaky fence.

4 They only plot to knock him from his high place; they enjoy lying; they praise with their words, but inside they curse. Pause and think about that.

5 My soul, wait only for God; my hope comes from him.

6 God is my only rock and savior; he protects me; I won't be shaken.

7 God is my savior and my honor; my strong protector and my shelter is in God.

8 Always trust in God; people, share your deepest feelings with Him: God is our safe place. Selah.

9 Truly, people of low rank are worthless, and those of high rank are not truthful; if weighed, they are all less than worthless together.

10 Do not trust in harsh treatment, and do not be proud of stealing. If you get richer, do not fix your heart on the money.

11 God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: power belongs to God.

12 To you, God, belongs kindness: because you give to each person based on what they do.
