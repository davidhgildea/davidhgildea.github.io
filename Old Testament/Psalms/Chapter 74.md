1 God, why have you rejected us forever? Why is your anger burning against the sheep of your field?

2 Remember your people whom you long ago bought; the tribe you saved, which is your heritage; this Mount Zion where you live.

3 Walk toward the endless ruins; see all the harm the enemy has done in the holy place.

4 Your enemies shout in your meeting places; they put up their flags as symbols.

5 A man was known for how much he used axes on large trees.

6 But now they smash its carved art all at once with axes and hammers.

7 They have thrown fire into your holy place; they have polluted it by tearing down where your name lives to the ground.

8 In their minds, they planned, "Let's wipe them out as one group; they have burned down all of God's meeting places in the country."

9 We no longer see our signs; there is no prophet left, and no one among us knows how long this will last.

10 God, how long will the enemy insult us? Will the foe disrespect your name forever?

11 Why do you pull back your hand, even your strong hand? Take it out from inside your coat.

12 God has always been my King, saving people all over the world.

13 You split the sea with your power; you crushed the sea monsters' heads in the waters.

14 You crushed the heads of the sea monster and gave it as food to the people living in the desert.

15 You split open fountains and streams; you dried up powerful rivers.

16 The day is yours, the night is also yours; you have made the light and the sun.

17 You have set all the earth's boundaries: you have made summer and winter.

18 Remember that the enemy has insulted you, God, and that the foolish people have disrespected your name.

19 Do not give your gentle one's life to many evil people; never forget your poor people's group.

20 Pay attention to the agreement; the world's dark places are full of cruel homes.

21 God, don't let the oppressed go back feeling ashamed; let the poor and needy praise your name.

22 Get up, God, defend your own case: Remember how the foolish person insults you every day.

23 Do not ignore the voice of your enemies: the noise of those who oppose you grows stronger all the time.
