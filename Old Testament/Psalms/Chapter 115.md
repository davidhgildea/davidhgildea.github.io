1 Not for us, God, not for us, but for your name give glory, because of your kindness and your truth.

2 Why should other nations ask, "Where is their God now?"

3 Our God is in heaven: he does whatever he wants.

4 Their idols are made of silver and gold; they are made by human hands.

5 They have mouths but don't speak; they have eyes but don't see.

6 They have ears but cannot hear, and they have noses but cannot smell.

7 They have hands but do not touch; they have feet but do not walk; they do not make sounds with their throats.

8 Those who make idols are like them; so is everyone who trusts in them.

9 Israel, trust in God: He is their help and shield.

10 Family of Aaron, trust in God; He is their help and protector.

11 If you respect God, trust in God: He is their help and protector.

12 God has remembered us; He will bless us; He will bless Israel's people; He will bless Aaron's family.

13 God will bless those who respect Him, no matter if they are unimportant or important.

14 God will make you and your children more and more prosperous.

15 You are blessed by God who made the sky and the earth.

16 The skies, and even the highest skies, belong to God; but He has given the earth to people.

17 Dead people cannot praise God, nor can anyone who goes into the quietness of death.

18 We will praise God now and forever. Praise God.
