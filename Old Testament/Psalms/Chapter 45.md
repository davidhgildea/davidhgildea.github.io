1 My heart is overflowing with a noble theme; I am sharing what I have composed about the king: my tongue is like the pen of a skilled writer.

2 You are more beautiful than any person; your words are full of grace; that's why God has blessed you forever.

3 Put your sword on your side, most powerful one, with your honor and greatness.

4 In your greatness, ride successfully for truth, humility, and justice; and your right hand will show you powerful things.

5 Your arrows are sharp and strike deep into the king's enemies, making the people fall before you.

6 Your throne, O God, lasts forever and ever; your kingdom's ruling staff is fair.

7 You love what is right and hate evil; therefore, God, your God, has chosen you and made you happier than your friends.

8 Your clothes have the scent of myrrh, aloe, and cassia from the grand palaces where they brought you joy.

9 The daughters of kings were among your respected women; the queen stood at your right side, dressed in Ophir's gold.

10 Listen, daughter, think about this and pay attention; also forget your own people and your father's home.

11 The king will really like how you look: because he is your Lord; and you should worship him.

12 The woman from Tyre will come with a present; the wealthy will seek your kindness.

13 The king's daughter is completely splendid inside; she wears clothes made of pure gold.

14 She will be presented to the king in embroidered clothes; her virgin friends following her will also be brought to you.

15 They will be brought with joy and happiness; they will go into the king's palace.

16 Your children will take the place of your ancestors, and you can make them leaders everywhere in the world.

17 I will make your name remembered in all generations: so the people will praise you forever and ever.
