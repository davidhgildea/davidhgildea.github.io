1 Praise God, my soul. O my God, you are very great; you are dressed in glory and splendor.

2 You cover yourself with light like clothes: you spread out the skies like a curtain.

3 He sets the beams for his rooms in the waters. He makes the clouds his carriage. He walks on the wings of the wind.

4 God makes his angels spirits and his servants like a blazing fire.

5 Who set the earth's foundations so it would never move.

6 You covered it with the deep like a garment; the waters stood over the mountains.

7 At your scolding they ran away; at the sound of your thunder they hurried off.

8 They climb the mountains; they go down into the valleys to the place you have created for them.

9 You have set a limit they cannot cross; they cannot come back to cover the earth.

10 He sends streams into the valleys; they flow between the hills.

11 They provide water for every animal in the field; the wild donkeys satisfy their thirst.

12 The birds of the sky will live there, singing in the branches.

13 He gives water to the hills from his home; the earth has all it needs from what you have done.

14 God makes grass grow for the cows, and plants for people to use, so they can get food from the ground.

15 Wine cheers people's hearts, oil makes their faces glow, and bread gives them strength.

16 God's trees are full of juice; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted.

17 Birds build their nests there; the stork makes its home in the fir trees.

18 High hills give wild goats safety; rocks give shelter to hyraxes.

19 God made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.

20 You make darkness, and it becomes night: when all the forest animals come out.

21 Young lions roar for their food and look to God for it.

22 The sun rises, they come together, and lie down in their dens.

23 A person goes out to work and works until evening.

24 God, how many are your works! In wisdom, you made them all: the earth is filled with your wealth.

25 This big, vast sea is home to countless creeping things, both tiny and huge creatures.

26 Ships sail there; the great sea creature you made plays in the waters.

27 They all wait for you to give them their food at the right time.

28 You give to them, and they collect; you open your hand, and they are satisfied with good things.

29 When you hide your face, they are scared; when you take their breath away, they die and turn back to dust.

30 You send out your spirit, and they are created; you renew the earth's surface.

31 God's glory will last forever; God will be happy with his creations.

32 God looks at the earth, and it shakes; he touches the mountains, and they smoke.

33 I will sing to God as long as I live: I will praise my God as long as I exist.

34 I will enjoy thinking about God: I will be happy with God.

35 Let the sinners vanish from the earth, and the wicked exist no more. Praise God, my soul. Praise God.
