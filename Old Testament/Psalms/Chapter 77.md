1 I called out to God loudly; I called to God, and he listened to me.

2 On the day I was in trouble, I looked for God. My pain continued all night and did not stop, and my heart would not be comforted.

3 I thought of God and felt upset; I complained, and my spirit felt crushed. Pause.

4 You keep me awake: I am so upset that I can't talk.

5 I have thought about the old days, the years from long ago.

6 I remember my night song; I talk with my heart; my spirit searches carefully.

7 Will God reject us forever? Will he never show favor again?

8 Has his kindness completely disappeared forever? Will his promise never come true?

9 Has God forgotten to be kind? Has he in anger closed off his compassion? Pause and think about that.

10 And I thought, "This is my weakness, but I will remember the years of God's powerful works."

11 I will remember what God has done; I will surely remember the amazing things you did long ago.

12 I will think about all your works and talk about what you have done.

13 Your path, God, is in the holy place: who is as mighty as our God?

14 You are the God who performs miracles; you have shown your power to the people.

15 With your strong arm, you rescued your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Pause.

16 The waters saw you, God, the waters saw you; they were scared: even the deep waters were disturbed.

17 The clouds released water; the sky made noise; your arrows flew everywhere.

18 Your thunder's sound was in the sky; the lightning lit up the world; the ground quaked and shook.

19 Your way is in the sea, your path is in the big waters, and no one knows your footsteps.

20 You led your people like sheep with Moses and Aaron guiding them.
