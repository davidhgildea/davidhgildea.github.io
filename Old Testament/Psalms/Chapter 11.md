1 I trust in God; why do you tell me to run away like a bird to the mountains?

2 Look, the evil ones pull back their bows, they put their arrows on the strings to secretly shoot at the good-hearted.

3 If the base is ruined, what can good people do?

4 God is in his holy temple; God's throne is in heaven. He watches and judges everyone.

5 God tests the good people, but hates the evil ones who love violence.

6 God will rain traps, fire, and sulfur on the wicked, along with a terrible storm: this will be what fills their cup.

7 God loves good people; He sees those who are honest.
