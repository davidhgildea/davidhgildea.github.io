1 God, so many are making trouble for me! Many are turning against me.

2 Many say about me, "God won't save him." (Pause)

3 But you, God, are a protector for me; my honor, and the one who lifts my head high.

4 I called to God with my voice, and He listened to me from His holy mountain. Selah.

5 I lay down and slept; I woke up because God supported me.

6 I will not fear thousands of people surrounding me, who are against me.

7 Get up, God; save me, my God: because you have hit all my enemies on the cheek; you have broken the teeth of the wicked.

8 God gives salvation; your blessing rests on your people. Pause.
