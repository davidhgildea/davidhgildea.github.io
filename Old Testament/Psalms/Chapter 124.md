1 If God hadn't been with us, let Israel say so now.

2 If God had not been with us when people attacked us:

3 Then they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger flared up against us.

4 Then the waters would have drowned us, the stream would have swept over us.

5 Then the high waters would have swept over us.

6 Praise God, who has not let us become victims to their teeth.

7 Our soul has escaped like a bird from the hunter's trap; the trap is broken, and we have escaped.

8 Our help comes from God, who created the sky and the earth.
