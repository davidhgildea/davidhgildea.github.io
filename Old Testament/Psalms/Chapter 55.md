1 Listen to my prayer, God, and do not ignore my request.

2 Listen to me and hear me: I am sad and complaining, and I am loud.

3 Because of the enemy's voice and the wicked's cruelty, they blame me for wrongs and hate me in anger.

4 My heart hurts deeply inside me, and fears of death have come over me.

5 I am scared and shaking, and horror has taken over me.

6 I wished for wings like a dove so I could fly away and find peace.

7 Look, then I would go far away and stay in the desert. Pause.

8 I would hurry to escape from the windy storm and tempest.

9 God, destroy and confuse their speech because I have seen violence and conflict in the city.

10 Day and night they move around on its walls; trouble and sadness are in its center.

11 Evil is everywhere in it: lies and trickery never leave its streets.

12 It wasn't an enemy who insulted me; if it were, I could have endured it. It wasn't someone who hated me who boasted against me; if it were, I could have hidden from him.

13 But you were my equal, my guide, and my friend.

14 We shared good advice together and went to God's house with others.

15 May death take them, and may they quickly go down to hell; for evil is in their homes and with them.

16 I will call on God, and God will save me.

17 I will pray in the evening, in the morning, and at noon. I will cry out loudly, and God will hear me.

18 God has saved my life peacefully from the fight against me, because many were with me.

19 God will listen and punish them, even the one from long ago. Pause. They don't change, so they don't fear God.

20 He has attacked those who were at peace with him; he has broken his agreement.

21 His mouth spoke nice words like butter, but his heart planned for war; his words were gentle like oil, but they were really sharp swords.

22 Give your worries to God, and he will support you; he will never let good people be shaken.

23 But you, God, will send the violent and lying people to a place of ruin: they won't live even half their expected years; but I will rely on you.
