1 His base is in the sacred mountains.

2 God loves the gates of Zion more than any homes of Jacob.

3 People say wonderful things about you, O city of God. Pause and think about that.

4 I will talk about Egypt and Babylon to my people; look at Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia; this person was born there.

5 People will say, "This person and that person were born in Zion," and God himself will make her strong.

6 God will take note, as he records the people, that this person was born there. Pause.

7 Singers and musicians will be there: all my sources of life are with you.
