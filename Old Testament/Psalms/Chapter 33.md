1 Be happy with God, you good people, because it's good for those who are right to give praise.

2 Praise God with the harp: sing to him with the psaltery and a ten-stringed instrument.

3 Sing a new song to God; play well with loud sounds.

4 God's message is true; everything he does is honest.

5 He loves what is right and fair; the world is filled with God's kindness.

6 God made the heavens by his word; and all the stars with his breath.

7 He brings the sea waters together like a pile; he stores the depths in storerooms.

8 Let everyone on earth fear God; let all the people of the world be amazed by him.

9 He spoke, and it happened; he gave an order, and it lasted.

10 God makes the plans of nations fail; He causes the schemes of people to have no effect.

11 God's plan lasts forever, his thoughts reach through all generations.

12 Happy is the country that has God as its God; and the people God has picked to be His own.

13 God looks from heaven; he sees all humans.

14 From where he lives, he watches everyone on earth.

15 He shapes everyone's heart the same; he looks at all they do.

16 No king is saved by having a big army; a strong man is not rescued by his great power.

17 A horse is not reliable for protection; it cannot save anyone by its great power.

18 Look, God watches over those who respect him, those who wait for his kindness.

19 To save them from death and to sustain them in times of hunger.

20 Our soul waits for God: He is our help and our protector.

21 Our heart will be happy in God because we have trusted in his holy name.

22 God, let your kindness be with us, just as we trust in you.
