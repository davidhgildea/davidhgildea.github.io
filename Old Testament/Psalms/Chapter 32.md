1 Happy is the person whose wrongdoings are forgiven, and whose sins are hidden.

2 Happy is the person whom God does not blame for wrongdoing, and who is honest in their heart.

3 When I stayed quiet, my bones grew weak because I groaned all day long.

4 Day and night your hand was hard on me: my energy became like the dryness of summer.

5 I admit my sin to you, and I haven't hidden my wrongs. I decided to tell you about my sins, and you forgave me. Selah.

6 Every good person will pray to you when you can be found. In times of great floods, they will not reach him.

7 You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble; you will surround me with songs of rescue. Pause.

8 I will teach you and show you the way to go; I will guide you with my eye.

9 Do not be like the horse or mule that have no understanding and need a bit and bridle to be controlled, or they will not come to you.

10 The wicked will have many troubles, but if you trust in God, you will be surrounded by mercy.

11 Be happy in God, and be joyful, you good people: and shout happily, all you who are honest in heart.
