1 When God freed the captives of Zion, we were like those who dream.

2 Our mouths were full of laughter and our tongues sang with joy. Then the nations said, "God has done great things for them."

3 God has done great things for us; we are happy about it.

4 Bring us back from being captives, God, like streams in the desert.

5 Those who plant with tears will harvest with joy.

6 The one who goes out and cries while carrying valuable seeds will surely come back with joy, bringing his harvest with him.
