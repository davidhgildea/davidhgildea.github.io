1 God, our Lord, how wonderful is your name all over the earth! You have put your greatness higher than the sky.

2 God has given strength through the words of children and babies to silence the enemy and the avenger.

3 When I look at your skies, the creation of your hands, the moon and the stars you set in place;

4 What is a person that you think of him? And a human that you visit him?

5 You made him a little less than the angels and crowned him with glory and honor.

6 You made him ruler over everything you created; you put everything under his control.

7 Every sheep and cow, and the wild animals of the field.

8 Birds in the sky, fish in the sea, and everything that moves through the sea paths.

9 God, our Master, how wonderful is your name throughout the earth!
