1 Why do the nations get angry, and the people think up useless plans?

2 The rulers of the world stand together, and the leaders plan together, against God and his chosen one, saying,

3 Let's tear off their chains and throw their ropes away from us.

4 God in heaven will laugh; He will mock them.

5 Then he will speak to them angrily and trouble them greatly in his upset.

6 I have placed my king on my holy mountain Zion.

7 I will tell the rule: God has said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your father."

8 Ask me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance and the farthest places on earth as your own.

9 You will break them with an iron rod; you will smash them like a clay pot.

10 Understand this, you kings: Listen and learn, you rulers of the world.

11 Serve God with respect, and be happy with caution.

12 Show love to the Son, or he may get angry, and you could be destroyed on your path, because his anger can flare up quickly. Happy are those who trust in him.
