1 Sing to God a new song; for he has done wonderful things: his right hand, and his holy arm, have won the victory.

2 God has shown his salvation; he has revealed his goodness for all nations to see.

3 God remembered his kindness and faithfulness to Israel's people: everyone on earth has seen our God's salvation.

4 Celebrate with joy to God, everyone on earth: be loud and happy, and sing praises.

5 Sing to God with the harp; use the harp and sing psalms.

6 Play trumpets and cornets to make happy sounds for God, the King.

7 Let the sea make noise, and everything in it; the earth, and everyone who lives on it.

8 Let the rivers applaud: let the hills celebrate together.

9 Before God; for he comes to judge the earth: he will judge the world fairly, and treat all people equally.
