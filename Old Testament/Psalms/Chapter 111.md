1 Praise God. I will praise God with all my heart, among the good people and the gathered crowd.

2 God's works are great, and all who enjoy them seek them out.

3 His work is noble and wonderful; and his goodness lasts forever.

4 He made his amazing deeds unforgettable: God is kind and very compassionate.

5 He has provided food to those who respect him; he will always remember his agreement.

6 He has shown his people the power of his actions, so that he can give them the lands of other nations.

7 What God does is true and fair; all his rules are certain.

8 They remain forever and ever, and are made with truth and honesty.

9 He brought freedom to his people; he ordered his agreement to last forever: his name is holy and worthy of respect.

10 Being afraid of God is the start of being wise; those who follow His rules understand things well: His praise lasts always.
