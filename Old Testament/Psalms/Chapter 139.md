</div>
1 God, you have looked into my heart and know everything about me.

2 You know when I sit and when I stand, you understand my thoughts from far away.

3 You surround my path and my rest, and you know all my ways.

4 God, before I speak, you know all of my words.

5 You surround me from behind and in front, and place your hand on me.

6 This knowledge is too amazing for me; it is too much, I can't grasp it.

7 Where can I go to escape your spirit? Where can I run to hide from you?

8 If I go up to heaven, you are there; if I lie down in the depths, you are there.

9 If I fly with the dawn's wings and live at the farthest part of the sea;

10 Even there, your hand will guide me, and your right hand will hold me.

11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me," even the night will be bright around me.

12 Even darkness can't hide from you; night shines like day: darkness and light are the same to you.

13 You have created my innermost parts; you knit me together in my mother's womb.

14 I will praise you because I am made in an amazing and wonderful way; your works are marvelous, and I know this very well.

15 You saw who I really was before I was born; when I was being formed in secret, intricately crafted as if deep within the earth.

16 Your eyes saw my unfinished body; all my parts were written in your book before any of them existed.

17 God, your thoughts are so precious to me! There are so many of them!

18 If I try to count them, they are more than the sand: when I wake up, I am still with you.

19 You will surely kill the wicked, God; so you violent people, get away from me.

20 They speak badly about you, God, and your enemies misuse your name.

21 Don't I hate those who hate you, God? And don't I feel upset with those who oppose you?

22 I strongly dislike them: I consider them my enemies.

23 Look inside me, God, and understand my heart: test me, and know what I think.

24 Check if there's any badness in me, and guide me on the forever path.
