1 I will praise you with all my heart; I will sing praises to you before other gods.

2 I will worship facing your holy temple and thank your name for your kindness and truth; because you have made your word greater than your name.

3 On the day I called out, you answered me and made my soul strong.

4 Every king on earth will praise you, God, when they hear what you say.

5 Yes, they will sing about God's paths: for God's glory is great.

6 Even though God is great, he cares for the humble, but he keeps his distance from the proud.

7 Even when I walk through trouble, you will bring me back to life. You will act against my enemies' anger, and your power will save me.

8 God will complete what is important to me; Your kindness, God, lasts forever; do not abandon what Your hands have made.
