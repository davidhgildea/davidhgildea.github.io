1 Help, God; for good people are gone; the loyal ones are missing among humans.

2 They say meaningless things to each other; they speak with flattering lips and a double heart.

3 God will stop all flattering lips and the tongue that speaks proud words.

4 Those who say, "We will succeed with our words; our lips belong to us. Who rules over us?"

5 Because poor people are hurt and needy people sigh, I will get up now, says God; I will save them from those who blow against them.

6 God's words are pure: like silver refined in a clay furnace, made pure seven times.

7 You will protect them, God; you will keep them safe from this generation forever.

8 Evil people are everywhere when the worst ones get power.
