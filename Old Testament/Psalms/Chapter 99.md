1 God rules; let the people shake with fear: he sits among the angels; let the earth quake.

2 God is great in Zion; He is above everyone.

3 Let them praise your great and awesome name; it is holy.

4 The king's power shows love for fairness; you set up equality, you carry out fair judgment and what is right in Jacob.

5 Praise God our God, and bow down at the place he rests his feet; because he is holy.

6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, and Samuel was among those who called on his name; they called on God, and he answered them.

7 He spoke to them from the cloud: they followed his instructions and the laws he gave them.

8 You answered them, O God our God: you were a God who forgave them, even though you punished their misdeeds.

9 Praise God, our God, and bow down on his sacred mountain; for God, our God, is pure.
