</div>
1 God, give the king your justice, and your righteousness to the king's son.

2 He will judge your people fairly and give fair decisions for your poor.

3 The mountains will give peace to the people, and the small hills will do it by being fair.

4 He will judge the poor fairly, save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor.

5 People will respect you as long as the sun and moon last, for all time to come.

6 He will come down like rain on cut grass, like showers that soak the earth.

7 During his time, good people will thrive; and there will be plenty of peace as long as the moon lasts.

8 He will rule from one sea to another, and from the river to the ends of the earth.

9 People living in the wild will kneel before him, and his enemies will lick the ground.

10 The kings of Tarshish and the islands will bring gifts; the kings of Sheba and Seba will present offerings.

11 Yes, all kings will bow down to him; all countries will serve him.

12 God will save the needy when they call out; the poor too, and those with no one to help them.

13 He will help the poor and needy and save the lives of those in need.

14 He will save them from lies and harm, and their lives will be valuable to him.

15 He will live, and he will receive gold from Sheba; people will always pray for him, and he will be praised every day.

16 A small amount of grain will grow in the land, even on the mountains; its produce will sway like the trees of Lebanon, and the city people will thrive like the grass on the ground.

17 His name will last forever; it will continue as long as the sun shines. People will be blessed through him; all countries will praise him.

18 Praise be to God, the God of Israel, who alone does wonderful things.

19 May his wonderful name be blessed forever; may the whole earth be full of his glory. Amen, Amen.

20 David, Jesse's son, has finished his prayers.
