1 The fool thinks to himself, there is no God. They are bad, they do terrible things, no one does good.

2 God looked from heaven at people to see if anyone understood and looked for God.

3 Everyone has turned away, they have all become corrupt; no one does good, not even one.

4 Do all the wrongdoers lack understanding? They devour my people as if eating bread, without calling on God.

5 They were greatly afraid because God is with those who are righteous.

6 You have made the advice of the poor seem worthless because God is their shelter.

7 I wish God would save Israel from Zion! When God frees his people, Jacob will be happy, and Israel will be joyful.
