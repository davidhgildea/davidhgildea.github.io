1 Come, let's sing to God: let's shout joyfully to the rock who saves us.

2 Let's come before God with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise to him with songs.

3 God is a great God and a great King above all gods.

4 In his hand are the world's depths; the hills' power is also his.

5 The sea belongs to God, and he created it; his hands shaped the land.

6 Come, let's worship and bow down; let's kneel before God our creator.

7 He is our God; we are his people, the sheep he cares for. If you listen to his voice today,

8 Do not make your heart hard, as when you challenged me, and as on the day of testing in the desert.

9 When your ancestors tested me, tried me, and saw what I did.

10 For forty years I was upset with that generation; I said, "They are people whose hearts go astray, and they do not understand my paths."

11 I promised in my anger that they would not enter my place of rest.
