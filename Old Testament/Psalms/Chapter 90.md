1 God, you have been our home through all the ages.

2 Before the mountains existed, or before you made the earth and the world, from forever in the past to forever in the future, you are God.

3 You turn people back to dust and tell them, "Come back, everyone."

4 To you, a thousand years are like yesterday when it is over, or like a few hours in the night.

5 You sweep them away like a flood; they are like sleep: in the morning they are like growing grass.

6 In the morning it blooms and grows; in the evening it is chopped down and dries up.

7 We are worn out by your anger and overwhelmed by your fury.

8 You have put our wrongdoings in front of you, our hidden sins in the light of your presence.

9 All our days vanish in your anger; we live our years like a story that's told.

10 Our lives last about 70 years or, if we are strong, 80 years. But even the best of these years are full of hard work and pain. Soon they pass, and we are gone.

11 Who understands how powerful your anger is? Your wrath matches the fear you deserve.

12 Help us to count our days so we learn to grow wiser.

13 Come back, God, how much longer? Change your mind about your servants.

14 Please let us experience your kindness early, so we can be happy and joyful all our lives.

15 Make us happy for as long as the times you let us have troubles, and for as many years as we have known sadness.

16 Show your work to your servants and your greatness to their children.

17 May God's beauty be with us: make the work of our hands strong; yes, make our work strong.
