1 Praise God. All you who serve God, praise God's name.

2 God's name is blessed from now on and forever.

3 From sunrise to sunset, God's name should be praised.

4 God is greater than all countries, and his greatness is higher than the skies.

5 Who is like God, our God, who lives on high?

6 God bows down to look at the things in heaven and on earth.

7 He lifts the poor from the ground and raises the needy from the dirt.

8 So he can place him with leaders, with his people's leaders.

9 God helps the woman with no children to have a family and be happy with her kids. Praise God.
