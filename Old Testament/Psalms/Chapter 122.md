1 I was happy when they told me, "Let's go to God's house."

2 We will stand inside your gates, Jerusalem.

3 Jerusalem is built as a city closely united.

4 The tribes go up, the tribes of God, to show Israel's proof, to thank God's name.

5 There are thrones set up for judging, the thrones of David's family.

6 Ask God for peace in Jerusalem: those who love you will do well.

7 May there be peace inside your walls and wealth within your homes.

8 For the sake of my friends and companions, I will say, "May peace be in you."

9 For the sake of God's house, I will work for your benefit.
