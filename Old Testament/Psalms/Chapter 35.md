1 God, defend me against those who argue with me; battle those who battle me.

2 Grab your shield and armor and stand up to help me.

3 Get your spear and block the path of those chasing me; tell me, "I am your rescue."

4 Let those who want to harm me be confused and embarrassed; let those who plan my downfall be turned away and thrown into disarray.

5 Let them be like dust in the wind and let God's angel chase them.

6 Let their path be dark and slippery, and let God's angel chase them.

7 They have set a trap for me without reason; they have dug a pit to capture me even though I did nothing wrong.

8 Let disaster surprise him; and let the trap he set catch him: let him fall into that very disaster.

9 My soul will be happy in God; it will celebrate His rescue.

10 Every bone in my body will say, "God, who is like you? You rescue the weak from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them."

11 Lying witnesses stood against me; they accused me of things I didn't know.

12 They repaid my good with evil and hurt my spirit.

13 But when they were sick, I wore sackcloth, I made my soul humble with fasting, and my prayer stayed with me.

14 I acted as if he were my friend or brother; I was very sad and bent over, like someone grieving for their mother.

15 During my hard times, they were happy and came together. Yes, the worthless people united against me without my knowing; they attacked me nonstop.

16 At parties, two-faced mockers angrily bit at me with their teeth.

17 God, how long will you watch? Save my life from their ruin, my precious one from the lions.

18 I will thank you in the large gathering; I will praise you among many people.

19 Do not let my enemies unfairly be happy over me, nor let those who hate me for no reason mock me with their eyes.

20 They don't talk about peace; instead, they plan lies against the peaceful people in the land.

21 Yes, they opened their mouths wide against me and said, "Aha, aha, we have seen it with our own eyes."

22 You have seen this, God: do not stay quiet: God, do not be far from me.

23 Get up and pay attention to my case, my God and my Lord.

24 Judge me, God, by your fairness; don't let them be happy at my expense.

25 Don't let them think, "This is just what we wanted," or say, "We have defeated him."

26 May those who take joy in my trouble be embarrassed and confused; may those who boast against me be covered in shame and disgrace.

27 Let those who support my just cause shout for joy and be happy; may they always say, "May God be praised, who delights in the well-being of his servant."

28 My tongue will talk about your goodness and praise you all day long.
