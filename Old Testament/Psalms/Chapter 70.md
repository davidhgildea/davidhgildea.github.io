1 Hurry, God, to save me; hurry to help me, God.

2 May those who want to harm me feel ashamed and confused; may they be turned away and filled with embarrassment.

3 Let those who mock and say, "Aha, aha," be pushed back and shamed for their actions.

4 May all who look for you be happy and joyful in you; and may those who love your rescue always say, "May God be praised."

5 I am poor and need help; hurry to me, God. You are my support and rescuer; God, do not delay.
