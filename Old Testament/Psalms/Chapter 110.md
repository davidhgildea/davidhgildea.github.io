</div>
1 God said to my Lord, "Sit at my right side until I make your enemies a place for your feet."

2 God will send out your mighty scepter from Zion: rule in the middle of your enemies.

3 Your people will willingly follow you when you show your power. Dressed in holy beauty like the fresh morning dew, you have the vitality of youth.

4 God has made a promise that cannot be changed: You are a priest forever, in the way of Melchizedek.

5 God at your side will defeat kings when he's angry.

6 He will judge the nations, fill the lands with dead bodies, and strike down rulers across many countries.

7 He will drink from the stream on his path; because of this, he will hold his head high.
