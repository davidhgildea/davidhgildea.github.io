1 Keep me safe, God, because I trust in you.

2 I told God, "You are my Lord; my goodness means nothing to you."

3 But to the holy people on earth, and to the outstanding ones, who bring me great joy.

4 People who follow other gods will have many troubles. I will not pour out blood offerings to them or speak their names.

5 God is my chosen share and my cup; you support my destiny.

6 My boundaries fall in nice places; yes, I have a wonderful inheritance.

7 I will bless God, who has given me advice; even at night, my thoughts teach me.

8 I always keep God in my thoughts: because he is by my side, I will stay strong.

9 So my heart is happy, and I proudly celebrate; my body too will rest with hope.

10 You will not leave my soul in hell; nor will you let your Holy One decay.

11 You will show me the way to life: being with you is complete happiness; at your side, there are joys that never end.
