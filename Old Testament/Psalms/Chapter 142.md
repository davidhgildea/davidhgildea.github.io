1 I called out to God with my voice; with my voice, I asked God for help.

2 I told God all my problems; I showed Him my troubles.

3 When I felt very upset, you knew where I was going. People have secretly set a trap for me on the path I took.

4 I looked to my right and saw no one recognized me; I had nowhere to run; nobody cared about me.

5 I called to you, God; I said, You are my safe place and my share among those who are alive.

6 Listen to my cry, for I am very weak; save me from those chasing me, for they are stronger than me.

7 Free me from my troubles so I can thank you. Good people will surround me because you are good to me.
