1 Happy are those who are pure in their ways, who follow God's law.

2 Happy are those who follow his instructions and search for him with all their heart.

3 They also do nothing wrong: they follow his paths.

4 You have told us to follow your instructions carefully.

5 I wish my life was guided to follow your rules!

6 Then I will not feel ashamed when I follow all your commands.

7 I will praise you with a true heart as I learn about your fair decisions.

8 I will follow your laws: Please don't completely abandon me.

9 How can a young person live a clean life? By following your word.

10 I have searched for you with all my heart; please don't let me stray from your commands.

11 I have kept your word in my heart, so I won't sin against you.

12 You are blessed, God; teach me your rules.

13 I have spoken of all the decisions that come from your mouth.

14 I have found joy in following your teachings as much as in great wealth.

15 I will think about your teachings and pay attention to your paths.

16 I will enjoy following your laws; I will not forget what you have said.

17 Be generous to me, your servant, so I may live and follow your teachings.

18 Help me see, so I can discover amazing things in your teachings.

19 I am a visitor on Earth; do not hide your commands from me.

20 My heart is sad because I always greatly desire your rules.

21 You have scolded the proud who are cursed because they stray from your commands.

22 Take away my disgrace and scorn, because I have followed your teachings.

23 Rulers sat and talked about me, but I thought about your laws.

24 Your teachings bring me joy and guide me.

25 My heart clings to the ground; give me life as you promised.

26 I have told you about my life, and you have listened: teach me your rules.

27 Help me understand your commands, so I can talk about your amazing deeds.

28 I feel very sad and weak; give me strength, as you have promised.

29 Take away from me the path of untruthfulness, and kindly give me your teaching.

30 I have chosen the path of truth; I keep your laws in front of me.

31 I have followed your teachings closely; God, do not let me be ashamed.

32 I will follow your commands more freely when you give me a greater understanding.

33 Teach me, God, the way of your laws; and I will follow it to the end.

34 Help me understand, so I can follow your rules; indeed, I will follow them with all my heart.

35 Guide me to follow your commands, because I find joy in them.

36 Turn my heart toward your teachings and away from greed.

37 Help me stop looking at worthless things; give me life following your path.

38 Make your promise to your servant strong, who respects you deeply.

39 Take away my shame that I am afraid of, because your decisions are good.

40 Look, I really want to follow your instructions; give me life through your goodness.

41 Let your kindness and help reach me, God, just as you promised.

42 Then I can reply to those who insult me, because I rely on your promise.

43 Don't remove the true word from my mouth; I have put my hope in your decisions.

44 I will always follow your laws forever and ever.

45 I will walk freely because I follow your teachings.

46 I will talk about your commands before rulers and will not feel ashamed.

47 I will take joy in following your commands, which I love.

48 I will raise my hands to your commands, which I love, and I will think deeply about your laws.

49 Remember your promise to me, your servant, which gives me hope.

50 God's words give me comfort and life when I am suffering.

51 Arrogant people mock me a lot, but I still follow your rules.

52 I remembered your old decisions, God, and they gave me comfort.

53 I am filled with horror because of the evil people who abandon your law.

54 Your laws have been my songs where I have traveled.

55 I remember your name, God, at night, and follow your teachings.

56 I had this because I followed your rules.

57 You are my share, God; I have promised to follow your words.

58 I asked for your favor with all my heart: show me mercy as you have promised.

59 I thought about what I do and decided to follow your teachings.

60 I hurried and did not delay to follow your commands.

61 Evil people have robbed me, but I have not forgotten your law.

62 At midnight I will get up to thank you because of your fair decisions.

63 I am friends with everyone who respects you and follows your teachings.

64 The earth, God, is full of your kindness: teach me your rules.

65 You have treated your servant well, God, just as you promised.

66 Teach me to make good choices and to understand well, because I trust your commands.

67 Before I suffered, I did wrong, but now I follow your teachings.

68 You are good, and you do good; teach me your rules.

69 Proud people have made up lies about me, but I will follow your rules with all my heart.

70 Their heart is as thick as fat; but I enjoy your law.

71 It is good for me that I suffered; so I could learn your laws.

72 Your rules are more valuable to me than a lot of gold and silver.

73 Your hands created and shaped me: help me understand, so I can follow your commands.

74 People who respect you will be happy when they see me; because I have trusted in your promise.

75 I know, God, that your decisions are right, and you have brought hardship on me because you are faithful.

76 Please let your kind mercy comfort me, just as you promised your servant.

77 Let your kind mercy reach me so I can live, for I take joy in your law.

78 Let the proud feel shame, for they wronged me for no reason; but I will think deeply about your teachings.

79 Let those who respect you come to me, and those who know your teachings.

80 Let my heart follow your rules so I won't feel shame.

81 I am weak with longing for your rescue, but I trust in your promise.

82 My eyes grow tired looking for your promise, asking, "When will you comfort me?"

83 I am like a wineskin in the smoke, but I don't forget your laws.

84 How many days does your servant have? When will you judge those who are persecuting me?

85 The proud have set traps for me, which do not follow your law.

86 All your commands are trustworthy; they chase me without cause; help me.

87 They almost destroyed me on earth; but I did not abandon your rules.

88 Give me life because of your kindness; then I will follow the guidance from your words.

89 Your word, God, is forever fixed in heaven.

90 Your faithfulness reaches every generation: you created the earth, and it stands firm.

91 They continue today following your laws, for all serve you.

92 If I had not enjoyed following your law, I would have died in my suffering.

93 I will always remember your teachings because they have given me life.

94 I belong to you; save me because I follow your teachings.

95 Evil people have set traps for me to harm me, but I will focus on following your teachings.

112 I have decided in my heart to follow your laws always, until the very end.

113 I dislike useless thoughts, but I love your law.

116 Support me as you have promised, so I can live, and do not let me be disappointed in my hope.

117 Support me, and I will be secure, and I will always follow your rules.

118 You have stepped on all who wander from your laws because their trickery is a lie.

119 You remove all the evil people on earth like impurities; that's why I love your teachings.

120 My body shakes with fear of you; I am scared of your decisions.

121 I have been fair and just: do not abandon me to those who oppress me.

122 Promise to protect your servant and don't let the proud harm me.

123 I can't see waiting for your rescue, and for your true promise.

124 Treat me, your servant, with kindness, and show me your rules.

125 I am your servant; help me understand, so I can know your teachings.

126 It is time for you, God, to act, because they have ignored your law.

127 So I love your rules more than gold, even the purest gold.

128 So I consider all your rules about everything to be good; and I dislike every untrue path.

129 Your teachings are amazing; that's why I follow them.

130 Your words bring light; they give understanding to the simple.

131 I opened my mouth and gasped because I desired your commands.

132 Please look at me and show me kindness, as you usually do for those who love your name.

133 Guide me by your teachings, and don't let any wrong control me.

134 Save me from human oppression, and I will follow your rules.

135 Let your face shine on your servant; and teach me your rules.

136 Tears flow from my eyes like rivers because people do not follow your law.

137 You are right, God, and your decisions are fair.

138 The commands you have given are just and very trustworthy.

139 My passion has overwhelmed me because my enemies have ignored your words.

140 Your word is very pure, so your servant loves it.

141 I am unimportant and not respected, but I still remember your teachings.

142 Your goodness lasts forever, and your rules are true.

147 I rose before dawn and cried for help; I put my hope in your word.

148 I stay awake before the night watches begin so I can think about your words.

149 Listen to my voice because of your kindness: God, give me life according to your decision.

150 Those who seek trouble are close by; they are far from your laws.

151 You are close, God, and all your commands are true.

152 About your instructions, I have long known that you established them forever.

153 See my suffering and rescue me, because I have not forgotten your law.
