1 God is truly good to Israel and to those who have a pure heart.

2 But as for me, I almost lost my footing; my steps nearly slipped.

3 I felt jealous of foolish people when I saw the success of the wicked.

4 In their death, they face no struggles, and they remain strong.

5 They don't have troubles like other people; they aren't afflicted like everyone else.

6 So pride surrounds them like a chain; violence covers them like clothes.

7 They have puffy eyes from being rich: they own more than anyone could desire.

8 They are bad, talking badly about making others suffer. They talk with great pride.

9 They speak against God above, and their words spread across the world.

10 So his people come back here, and they are given plenty to drink.

11 And they ask, "Does God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?"

12 Look, these are the wicked, who succeed in life; they grow rich.

13 I truly cleaned my heart for nothing, and washed my hands being innocent.

14 All day I suffer and am punished each morning.

15 If I decide to speak like this, I realize I would upset your children's generation.

16 When I tried to understand this, it was too hard for me.

17 Until I went into God's sanctuary; then I understood their fate.

18 You truly put them in risky places; you threw them down to ruin.

19 How suddenly they are ruined! They are completely destroyed by fears.

20 Like a dream when someone wakes up; so God, when you wake up, you will look down on their appearance.

21 My heart was sad, and I felt a sharp pain inside.

22 I was foolish and did not understand; I was like an animal before you.

23 I am always with you; you hold my right hand.

24 You will guide me with your advice, and later take me to heaven.

25 Who else do I have in heaven but you? And on earth, I want no one but you.

26 My body and heart may grow weak, but God is the strong source of my heart and my share forever.

27 Those far from you will die; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.

28 It is good for me to get close to God. I trust in God so I can tell about all your deeds.
