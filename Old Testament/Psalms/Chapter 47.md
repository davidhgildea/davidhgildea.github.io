1 Clap your hands, everyone; shout to God with happy voices.

2 God is supreme and awesome; he is a mighty ruler over the whole earth.

3 He will bring the people under our control, and the nations under our feet.

4 God will pick our land for us, the best land of Jacob whom He loved. Pause.

5 God has ascended with cheers; God with the blast of a trumpet.

6 Praise God, praise him; sing to our King, praise him.

7 God is the king of the whole earth: sing praises with insight.

8 God rules over the nations; God sits on His holy throne.

9 The leaders of the nations come together, including the people who worship the God of Abraham: all the defenders of the world are under God's power: He is highly honored.
