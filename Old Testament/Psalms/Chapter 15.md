1 God, who will live in your tent? Who will stay on your sacred mountain?

2 The person who lives rightly, does what is just, and tells the truth in their heart.

3 He who does not talk badly about others with his tongue, does not harm his neighbor, and does not insult his neighbor.

4 He looks down on those who are bad, but respects those who respect God. He keeps his promises, even when it costs him.

5 Someone who does not lend money for interest or take bribes to hurt the innocent will always stand firm.
