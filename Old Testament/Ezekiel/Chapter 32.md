1 In the twelfth year, on the first day of the twelfth month, God spoke to me.

2 Human, sing a sad song for the Pharaoh of Egypt, and tell him: You are like a strong lion among the nations, and like a large sea creature in the oceans. You came out with your rivers, stirred up the water with your feet, and made their rivers dirty.

3 God says, "I will spread my net over you with a group of many people; and they will pull you up in my net."

4 I will leave you on the land, throw you into the open field, let birds from the sky sit on you, and fill the animals of the earth with you.

5 I will put your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains.

6 I will also soak the land where you swim with your blood, up to the mountains; and the rivers will overflow with you.

7 When I make you go away, I will hide the sky and darken the stars; I will cover the sun with clouds, and the moon will not shine.

8 I will turn off all the bright lights in the sky above you and make your land dark, says God.

9 I will trouble many people's hearts when I bring your ruin to nations, to places you do not know.

10 Yes, I will make many people shocked at you, and their kings will be very scared because of you, when I wave my sword in front of them; and they will shake in fear all the time, each person for their own life, on the day you fall.

11 God says the king of Babylon's sword will come against you.

12 Mighty warriors will use their swords to make your crowds fall, even the most feared from all nations, and they will take away Egypt's splendor; all its masses will be wiped out.

13 I will also wipe out all the animals near the big waters; people will not disturb them again, nor will animal hoofs.

14 I will make their waters deep and their rivers flow smoothly, says God.

15 When I make Egypt empty and the land has nothing left that once filled it, when I strike down all who live there, then they will know that I am God.

16 This is the sad song that people will sing to mourn her: women from different countries will mourn for her and for the many people of Egypt, says God.

17 In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, God's message came to me, saying.

18 Human, cry for the many people of Egypt, and bring them down, her and the daughters of powerful nations, to the depths of the earth, with those who descend into the pit.

19 Who do you surpass in beauty? Go down and lie with those who are not circumcised.

20 They will die among those killed by the sword: she is handed over to the sword: pull her out with all her crowds.

21 The powerful ones will speak to him from the place of the dead, along with his helpers: they have fallen and now lie dead, killed by the sword.

22 Asshur and her group are there; graves surround him, all killed by the sword.

23 Their graves are on the edge of the pit, and her group surrounds her grave: all of them killed, fallen by the sword, which spread fear in the land of the living.

24 Elam and all her people are around her tomb, all killed by the sword, and now lie in the lower parts of the earth, uncut. They spread fear when alive, but now they carry their disgrace with others in the pit.

25 They made her a bed among the dead with her many people: their graves surround her: all of them were not circumcised, killed by the sword: even though they scared people in the land of the living, they carry their disgrace with those who go down to the grave: he is placed among the dead.

26 Meshech, Tubal, and their people are there; their graves surround him. All are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, even though they spread fear among the living.

27 They will not rest with the powerful who have died, those uncircumcised who went to the grave with their weapons of war: they placed their swords under their heads, yet their sins remain with their bones, even though they once scared the strong in the world of the living.

28 Yes, you will be broken among the uncircumcised and will lie with those killed by the sword.

29 Edom, its kings, and all its leaders, with their strength, are with those killed by the sword: they will rest with the uncircumcised and those who go down to the grave.

30 The leaders from the north and all the people from Sidon have gone down with the dead, feeling ashamed of their power. They lie dead, not circumcised, with those killed by the sword, and share their disgrace with those who go down to the grave.

31 Pharaoh will see them and feel better about all his people, even Pharaoh and his whole army killed with the sword, says God.

32 I have brought my fear to the living land: and he will be placed among the uncut with those killed by the sword, including Pharaoh and all his crowds, says God.
