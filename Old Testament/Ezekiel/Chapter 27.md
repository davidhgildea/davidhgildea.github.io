1 God spoke to me again and said,

2 Now, you human, sing a sad song for Tyre.

3 Tell the city of Tyre, you who are located by the sea gateway and trade with many islands, "God says: O Tyre, you claim to be perfectly beautiful."

4 Your borders are surrounded by the seas, your builders have made you very beautiful.

5 They made all your ship planks from Senir's fir trees; they took Lebanon's cedars to make masts for you.

6 They made your oars from the Bashan oaks; your seats are carved ivory from the Ashurites, brought from the islands of Chittim.

7 You used fine linen and embroidered fabric from Egypt for your sail; blue and purple from the Elishah islands were your covers.

8 The people of Zidon and Arvad sailed your ships; the skilled men of Tyre in you were your captains.

9 The elders of Gebal and its skilled people were in you to seal your ships: all the sea's ships and their sailors were there to trade your goods.

10 People from Persia, Lud, and Phut were in your army, your warriors: they carried shields and helmets; they made you look splendid.

11 The soldiers from Arvad and your army were on your walls all around, and the warriors were in your towers. They put their shields on your walls all around; they made your city very beautiful.

12 Tarshish traded with you because you had many riches; they exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your goods.

13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your traders; they exchanged people and bronze items in your market.

14 The people from Togarmah did business at your markets with horses, horsemen, and mules.

15 The traders from Dedan traded with you; many islands gave you goods: they gave you ivory tusks and ebony as gifts.

16 Syria traded with you because you made many goods; they exchanged emeralds, purple fabric, embroidered cloth, fine linen, coral, and agate at your markets.

17 Judah and Israel were your traders; in your marketplace they exchanged wheat from Minnith, Pannag, honey, oil, and balm.

18 Damascus traded with you because you made many goods, exchanging them for lots of riches, Helbon wine, and white wool.

19 Dan and Javan traveled back and forth, busy in your markets: shiny iron, cassia, and sweet cane were among your goods.

20 Dedan was your trader in fancy fabrics for carts.

21 Arabia and Kedar's leaders traded with you in lambs, rams, and goats; these were your business partners.

22 The traders from Sheba and Raamah were your traders; they traded at your markets with the best spices, precious stones, and gold.

23 Haran, Canneh, and Eden, and the traders from Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad were your traders.

24 These were your traders with all kinds of goods, in blue fabrics, decorated cloth, and rich clothing in cedar chests tied with ropes among your items for sale.

25 Tarshish's ships sang about you in your market; you were filled and made very glorious on the seas.

26 Your rowers took you into deep waters: the east wind has shattered you in the middle of the seas.

27 Your wealth, markets, goods, sailors, navigators, ship repairers, traders, soldiers, and everyone else with you will fall into the sea when you are destroyed.

28 The areas around will tremble when they hear your pilots' shouts.

29 Everyone who rows, the sailors, and all the sea captains will get off their ships and stand on the land.

30 They will raise their voices against you, cry loudly, throw dust on their heads and roll in ashes.

31 They will shave their heads for you, wear rough cloth as a sign of sadness, and cry for you with deep sorrow and loud cries.

32 During their crying, they will mourn for you, saying, "What city is like Tyre, like the ruined one in the sea?"

33 When your goods were sent out to sea, you supplied many people; you made the kings of the earth rich with your wealth and goods.

34 When you are destroyed by the seas deep in the water, your goods and everyone with you will sink.

35 Everyone living on the islands will be shocked at you, and their kings will be very scared; they will look worried.

36 The traders among the people will scorn you; you will be feared, and never exist again.
