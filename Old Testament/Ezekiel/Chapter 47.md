1 Later, he took me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water flowing out from beneath the entrance toward the east, since the temple faced east. The water was coming down from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar.

2 He led me from the north gate and took me outside to the outer east-facing gate. I saw water flowing on the right side.

3 When the man with the measuring line went east, he measured a thousand units, and led me through water up to my ankles.

4 He measured another thousand and led me through water up to my knees. Then he measured another thousand and led me through water up to my waist.

5 Then he measured a thousand cubits, and it became a river too deep to walk across, with water deep enough to swim in, a river that couldn't be crossed on foot.

6 He said to me, "Human, have you seen this?" Then he took me back to the edge of the river.

7 When I came back, I saw many trees along both sides of the riverbank.

8 He told me, "These waters flow to the eastern region, go down into the desert, and enter the sea. When they reach the sea, its waters will become fresh.

9 Everything that is alive and moves, wherever the rivers flow, will survive. There will be a lot of fish because the waters will flow there and heal them; everything will live where the river goes.

10 Fishers will stand by it, from Engedi to Eneglaim; there they will spread out nets; their fish will be of many types, like the fish of the great sea, very many.

11 But its muddy parts and its swamps will not be healed; they will be left to salt.

12 By the river, on both sides of its bank, all kinds of trees will grow for food. Their leaves won't wither, and their fruit won't run out. They will produce new fruit every month because they are watered by a stream from the holy place. Their fruit will be for eating, and their leaves for healing.

13 God says: This will be the border you use to divide the land for Israel's twelve tribes: Joseph will get two shares.

14 You will all receive it as your own: I promised to give it to your ancestors, and this land will become your inheritance.

15 This will be the northern border of the land: it starts from the Great Sea and goes toward Hethlon and on to Zedad.

16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, between the border of Damascus and Hamath; Hazarhatticon, near the coast of Hauran.

17 The border starting at the sea will reach Hazarenan, touch Damascus, and extend to the far north, including Hamath's boundary. This is the northern side.

18 Measure the east side from Hauran, Damascus, Gilead, and the land of Israel by Jordan, to the eastern border. This is the east side.

19 The south border goes from Tamar to the Waters of Strife at Kadesh, then follows the river to the Great Sea. This is the south border.

20 The west side will be the big sea from the border to where you face Hamath. That is the west side.

21 You will split this land among yourselves based on the tribes of Israel.

22 You will divide the land by drawing lots to determine who will inherit it, both for yourselves and for the foreigners who live with you and have children among you. They will be treated like native-born Israelites and will share in the inheritance among the tribes of Israel.

23 When a foreigner lives with any of your tribes, you must give them their share of land, says God.
