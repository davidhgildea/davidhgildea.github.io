1 God spoke to me again, saying,

2 Human, look toward the Ammonites and speak against them.

3 Tell the Ammonites, listen to God's word: This is what God says, "Because you mocked my sanctuary when it was defiled, mocked the land of Israel when it was empty, and mocked the people of Judah when they were taken captive.

4 So, I will give you to the people from the east to own, and they will build their houses in you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.

5 I will turn Rabbah into a place for camels to rest, and the Ammonites into a resting place for sheep; and you will know that I am God.

6 God says, because you clapped your hands, stomped your feet, and were happy in your heart with all your hate for the land of Israel;

7 So I will reach out my hand against you, and give you as loot to the nations; I will cut you off from the peoples, and make you vanish from the countries: I will destroy you, and you will know that I am God.

8 God says, "Because Moab and Seir claim, 'Look, the tribe of Judah is like other nations;

9 So, I will expose Moab, starting from its cities on its borders, the best of the land, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim.

10 I will give the eastern lands to the men, including the Ammonites' lands, so that no one will remember the Ammonites among the nations.

11 I will punish Moab, and they will know that I am God.

12 God says: Because Edom acted against the people of Judah, seeking revenge and committing great wrongs against them,

13 So God says: I will reach out my hand against Edom, and remove people and animals from it; I will make it empty from Teman, and those from Dedan will die by the sword.

14 I will take revenge on Edom through my people Israel; they will act in Edom with my anger and fury; and they will understand my revenge, says God.

15 God says: Because the Philistines acted for revenge with spiteful hearts, wanting to destroy because of their ancient hatred;

16 So God says: Look, I will reach out my hand against the Philistines, I will wipe out the Cherethites, and remove the survivors of the seashore.

17 I will punish them severely and angrily; and they will know that I am God when I take revenge on them.
