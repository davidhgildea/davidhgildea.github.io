1 Also, when you divide the land to inherit it, you must set aside a special gift for God, a holy part of the land. It will be 25,000 units long and 10,000 units wide. All around this holy area will be considered sacred.

2 The sacred area will be a square, 500 units long and 500 units wide, with a 50-unit border around it.

3 Measure an area that is twenty-five thousand units long and ten thousand units wide; this will be the location of the holy sanctuary and the most holy place.

4 The special part of the land will be for the priests who serve in the holy place, and who approach to serve God. It will provide space for their homes and a sacred area for the holy place.

5 The area 25,000 units long and 10,000 units wide will also be for the Levites, who serve at the temple, as their own property with twenty rooms.

6 You must set aside for the city an area 5,000 units wide and 25,000 units long, next to the sacred part of the land. This will be for all the people of Israel.

7 A share of land will be for the leader on both sides of the sacred offering area and the city property, in front of the sacred offering area and the city property, from the west end to the east end. The length will match one of the sections, from the western boundary to the eastern boundary.

8 He will own land in Israel, and my leaders will not oppress my people anymore; they will give the rest of the land to the families of Israel.

9 God says, "That's enough, leaders of Israel: stop the violence and destruction, make fair decisions and act justly, stop taking things unfairly from my people," says God.

10 You must use fair scales, a fair ephah, and a fair bath.

11 The ephah and the bath will have the same size, so that the bath holds one-tenth of a homer and the ephah also holds one-tenth of a homer. Their size will be based on the homer.

12 A shekel equals twenty gerahs. Use twenty shekels, plus twenty-five shekels, plus fifteen shekels, for your maneh.

13 Offer this gift: one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.

14 About the oil rule, for each oil bath, you should give one-tenth of a bath from a cor, which is the same as an homer of ten baths, because ten baths make an homer.

15 Take one lamb from every two hundred from the rich pastures of Israel for a food offering, a burnt offering, and peace offerings to ask for forgiveness for them, says God.

16 Every person in the country must give this offering for the leader in Israel.

17 It is the leader's duty to provide burnt sacrifices, food gifts, and drink gifts during festivals, new moon celebrations, and Sabbaths, at all special times for the people of Israel. He must arrange the sin sacrifice, the food offering, the burnt sacrifice, and the offerings for well-being to ask for forgiveness for the people of Israel.

18 God says: On the first day of the first month, you must take a young bull with no marks and clean the holy place.

19 The priest will take some blood from the sin sacrifice and put it on the doorframes of the house, on the four edges of the altar's base, and on the doorframes of the entrance to the inner yard.

20 On the seventh day of each month, do this for anyone who sins or who does not understand, to make the house clean.

21 In the first month, on the fourteenth day, you must celebrate Passover, a seven-day festival; eat bread without yeast.

22 On that day, the leader will provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land.

23 For seven days of the festival, he must make a burnt offering to God every day: seven bulls and seven male sheep that are perfect, and one goat every day for a sin offering.

24 He must offer a food gift of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, and a quart of oil with each ephah.

25 On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he must do the same things during the seven-day festival, just like for the sin offering, burnt offering, grain offering, and oil.
