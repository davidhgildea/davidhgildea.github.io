1 God spoke to me and said,

2 Human, look towards Gog of the land of Magog, the top leader of Meshech and Tubal, and speak out against him.

3 Say, God says, "Look, I am against you, Gog, the top ruler of Meshech and Tubal."

4 I will make you turn back, put hooks in your jaws, and bring you out with all your army, with horses and riders, all fully armed, a huge crowd with shields and helmets, all carrying swords.

5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them; all are carrying shields and wearing helmets.

6 Gomer and his groups, the family of Togarmah from the north, and all their groups, with many people with you.

7 Get ready and make sure you and all your group gathered around you are prepared, and you keep watch over them.

8 After a long time, you will be visited. In the last years, you will enter the land that has recovered from war, which is collected from many nations, against the mountains of Israel, that have always been deserted. But now it has been taken from the nations, and they all will live there safely.

9 You will rise and come like a storm, you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your groups, and many others with you.

10 God says: It will happen that you will get an idea and think a bad thought.

11 I will say, I will go up to the land of open villages; I will go to those who are peaceful, living safely, all living without walls, without bars or gates.

12 To seize loot and capture prey; to strike at the once-empty places that are now settled, and against the people gathered from different countries, who have acquired livestock and possessions and live in the center of the land.

13 Sheba, Dedan, and Tarshish's traders, along with their strong young people, will ask you, "Have you come to take valuable things? Have you brought your group to steal? To take away silver, gold, animals, and other possessions, to take a lot of loot?"

14 So, human, prophesy and tell Gog, "God says: When my people Israel live in safety, won't you realize it?"

15 You will come from your land in the north with many people, all on horses, a large group and a strong army.

16 You will attack the people of Israel like a cloud covering the land. This will happen in the future, and I will bring you to my land so that the nations will know me when I show my holiness through you, O Gog, for all to see.

17 God says: Are you the one I talked about long ago through my prophets in Israel? They said for many years I would bring you against them.

18 When Gog attacks the land of Israel, God says, my anger will show on my face.

19 Because I am jealous and very angry, I have promised that there will be a huge earthquake in the land of Israel on that day.

20 So that the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the animals on the land, all small creatures that crawl on the ground, and all people on earth, will tremble before me, and the mountains will crumble, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will fall to the ground.

21 I will send a sword against him over all my mountains, says God: everyone's sword will turn against his brother.

22 I will fight against him with disease and bloodshed; I will pour down on him, his troops, and the many people with him, heavy rain, big hailstones, fire, and sulfur.

23 I will show my greatness and holiness; I will be recognized by many nations, and they will know that I am God.
