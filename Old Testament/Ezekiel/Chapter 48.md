1 Here are the names of the tribes. Starting from the northern tip, along the road to Hethlon, towards Hamath, and up to Hazar Enan at the northern border of Damascus, to Hamath's edge. These are the eastern and western limits. This is Dan's share.

2 Next to Dan's land, from the east side to the west side, land for Asher.

3 Next to Asher's boundary, from the east side to the west side, there is a part for Naphtali.

4 Next to Naphtali's border, from the east to the west, a piece of land for Manasseh.

5 Next to Manasseh's boundary, from the east side to the west side, comes a section for Ephraim.

6 Next to Ephraim's territory, from the east side to the west side, there will be land for Reuben.

7 Next to Reuben's territory, from the east to the west, there will be a section for Judah.

8 By Judah's border, from the east to the west, you must give a land offering 25,000 reeds wide, and as long as one of the other sections, from the east to the west. The sacred place will be in the center of it.

9 The gift you give to God must be twenty-five thousand units long and ten thousand units wide.

10 This special gift for the priests will be: 25,000 units long in the north, 10,000 units wide in the west, 10,000 units wide in the east, and 25,000 units long in the south; God's holy place will be right in the center.

11 It will belong to the holy priests from Zadok's descendants, who followed my commands and did not go wrong when the Israelites went wrong, unlike the Levites.

12 The land they offer will be very holy for them, next to the Levites' land.

13 Near the priests' area, the Levites will have a space measuring 25,000 units long and 10,000 units wide. The whole area will be 25,000 units long and 10,000 units wide.

14 They must not sell, trade, or give away the first of the crops, because it is sacred to God.

15 The five thousand area left next to the twenty-five thousand area will be a common space for the city, for living, and for the outskirts; and the city will be in the middle of it.

16 The sizes will be; the north side 4,500, the south side 4,500, the east side 4,500, and the west side 4,500.

17 The city's surrounding land will be 250 units to the north, 250 units to the south, 250 units to the east, and 250 units to the west.

18 The remaining length next to the holy area will be ten thousand to the east and ten thousand to the west. This area next to the holy part will be used to grow food for those who work for the city.

19 Those who work for the city will come from all the tribes of Israel.

20 The offering must be a square, 25,000 by 25,000 units; give this holy offering with the city's land included.

21 The rest will belong to the ruler, on both sides of the sacred offering and the city property, next to the 25,000 units of the offering on the east edge, and on the west, also next to the 25,000 units towards the west edge, lined up with the ruler's own shares. This will be the sacred offering, and the temple will be right in the center.

22 Also, from the land belonging to the Levites and the land of the city, which is in the middle of the prince's land, between Judah's territory and Benjamin's territory, will belong to the prince.

23 The other tribes, from east to west, will include Benjamin's land.

24 Next to Benjamin's border, from east to west, Simeon will have a share.

25 Next to Simeon's territory, from the east side to the west side, is Issachar's share.

26 Next to Issachar's territory, from east to west, is Zebulun's land.

27 Next to Zebulun's boundary, from the east to the west, is Gad's share.

28 Next to Gad's territory, on the south, the boundary will run from Tamar to the Meribah waters in Kadesh, then along the river to the big sea.

29 This is the land you will distribute by drawing lots to the tribes of Israel for them to inherit, and these are their shares, says God.

30 Here are the city's northern exit points, 4,500 units long.

31 The city gates will be named for Israel's tribes: three gates on the north; one for Reuben, one for Judah, one for Levi.

32 On the east side, 4,500 units long, with three gates: one gate for Joseph, one gate for Benjamin, and one gate for Dan.

33 On the south side, four thousand five hundred units long with three gates: one gate for Simeon, one for Issachar, and one for Zebulun.

34 On the west side, 4,500 units with their three gates: one gate for Gad, one gate for Asher, one gate for Naphtali.

35 The city was 18,000 units around, and from that day on it will be called "God is there."
