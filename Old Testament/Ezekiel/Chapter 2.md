1 He said to me, "Human, stand on your feet, and I will talk to you."

2 The spirit came into me as he spoke to me and put me on my feet, so I could hear the one who was speaking to me.

3 He told me, "Human, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They are a nation that has rebelled against me. Both they and their ancestors have sinned against me up to this very day.

4 They are bold and stubborn children. I am sending you to them; you will tell them, 'This is what God says.'

5 Whether they listen or not (because they are stubborn), they will realize that a prophet has been with them.

6 You, human, don't be scared of them or their words, even if you're with thorns and live among scorpions. Don't fear what they say or get upset by their looks, even if they are defiant.

7 You must tell them my words, whether they listen or not, because they are very rebellious.

8 But you, human, listen to what I tell you; don't be rebellious like those rebels: open your mouth and eat what I give you.

9 When I looked, I saw a hand reaching out to me with a scroll in it.

10 He showed it to me; it had writing on the front and back, and it said there were sadness, crying, and terrible pain.
