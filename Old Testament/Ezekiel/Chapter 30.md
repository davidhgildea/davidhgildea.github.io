1 God spoke to me again, saying,

2 Human, speak God's message: Cry out, 'What a terrible day!'

3 The day is coming soon, even God's day is close, a dark day; it will be the time for non-believers.

4 A sword will come to Egypt, and Ethiopia will be in great pain when people are killed in Egypt, their crowds taken, and their strong bases destroyed.

5 Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, all mixed peoples, Chub, and allies will fall by the sword together.

6 God says, "Those who support Egypt will fall; their great power will be brought low. They will fall by the sword from the stronghold of Syene," says God.

7 They will be empty among empty lands, and her cities will be among ruined cities.

8 They will know that I am God when I start a fire in Egypt and all her allies are ruined.

9 On that day, I will send messengers in ships to scare the unprepared Ethiopians, and they will feel great pain like in the time of Egypt, because look, it's coming.

10 God says, I will also end the large number of people in Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.

11 He, his people, and the fiercest from different nations will come to destroy the land. They will attack Egypt with their swords and fill the land with the dead.

12 I will dry up the rivers and hand the land over to the wicked; I will turn the land empty, along with everything in it, through strangers. I, God, have said this.

13 God says, I will destroy the idols and stop their images in Noph; there will be no more a prince in Egypt, and I will bring fear to Egypt.

14 I will make Pathros empty, and I will start a fire in Zoan, and I will carry out judgements in No.

15 I will pour out my anger on Sin, the fortress of Egypt; and I will destroy the many people of No.

16 I will start a fire in Egypt: Sin will be in great pain, No will be torn apart, and Noph will suffer every day.

17 The young men of Aven and Pibeseth will die by the sword, and these cities will be taken captive.

18 In Tehaphnehes too, the day will turn dark when I break Egypt's chains. Its proud power will end, a cloud will cover it, and its towns will be taken captive.

19 I will carry out punishments in Egypt, and they will understand that I am God.

20 In the eleventh year, on the first day of the first month, God's message came to me.

21 Human, I have made Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, weak; his power will not be restored, he won't be healed or able to use his strength to fight.

22 So God says: I am against the king of Egypt, Pharaoh. I will break his powerful arms, both the strong one and the already broken one, and make him drop his sword.

23 I will spread the Egyptians among different nations and scatter them throughout the countries.

24 I will make the king of Babylon strong and give him my sword, but I will break the power of Pharaoh, and he will moan in front of him like someone fatally injured.

25 I will give strength to Babylon's king, while Egypt's pharaoh will lose power; they will realize I am God when I give my sword to Babylon's king to use against Egypt.

26 I will spread the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them in different countries; then they will understand that I am God.
