1 This is the rule for the guilt offering: it is very holy.

2 In the spot where they kill the burnt sacrifice, they must also kill the guilt sacrifice, and its blood should be sprinkled all around the altar.

3 He must offer all of its fat; the tail and the fat covering the insides.

4 Take out the two kidneys with the fat around them near the loins, and the fatty tissue above the liver along with the kidneys.

5 The priest will burn them on the altar as an offering to God by fire; it is a guilt offering.

6 Every male priest may eat it; it must be eaten in a sacred place; it is very holy.

7 The sin offering and the trespass offering are the same; there is one rule for both: the priest who uses it to make amends will keep it.

8 The priest who presents someone's burnt sacrifice will keep the skin of that burnt offering for himself.

9 All the grain offerings baked in the oven, or cooked in the frying pan, or on a griddle, belong to the priest who offers them.

10 Every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be shared equally among Aaron's sons.

11 This is the rule for the peace offering sacrifice that a person will give to God.

12 If he brings it to say thank you, then with the thank you offering he must bring bread without yeast mixed with oil, thin crackers without yeast covered with oil, and cakes mixed with oil made of fine flour that are cooked.

13 Along with the cakes, he must also present yeast bread as part of his thanksgiving peace offering.

14 From the offering, one part should be given as a gift to God, and it belongs to the priest who splashes the blood of the peace offerings.

15 The meat from his peace offering for giving thanks must be eaten on the day it is offered; none of it should be kept until the next morning.

16 If his sacrifice is a promise or a free-will gift, it must be eaten on the day he makes his sacrifice. Any leftovers can be eaten the next day.

17 The rest of the meat from the offering must be burned on the third day.

18 If someone eats any meat from their peace offering on the third day, it won't be accepted, and the person who offered it won't get credit for it. It will be considered disgusting, and the person who eats it will be guilty.

19 Meat that touches anything unclean cannot be eaten; it must be burned: and about the meat, all who are clean can eat it.

20 But the person who eats from the peace offering sacrifice that belongs to God while they are unclean, that person will be separated from their people.

21 Anyone who touches something unclean, like human impurity, an unclean animal, or any unclean disgusting thing, and then eats from the peace offering dedicated to God, that person will be cut off from their community.

22 God spoke to Moses, saying,

23 Tell the people of Israel, you must not eat any fat, from a cow, or a sheep, or a goat.

24 You can use the fat of an animal that dies on its own or one killed by other animals for other purposes, but you must not eat it.

25 Anyone who eats the fat of an animal that is offered as a fire sacrifice to God will be separated from their community.

26 You must not eat any kind of blood, from birds or animals, in any place you live.

27 Anyone who eats any kind of blood will be separated from their community.

28 God spoke to Moses and said.

29 Tell the people of Israel, whoever gives their peace offering to God must present it to God as their peace offering gift.

30 He must use his own hands to bring God's offerings burnt by fire, the fat and the breast, so he can wave the breast as a wave offering before God.

31 The priest will burn the fat on the altar, but the breast will belong to Aaron and his sons.

32 Give the right shoulder to the priest as a lifted gift from your peace offerings.

33 The priest from Aaron's descendants who presents the blood and fat of the fellowship offering will get the right shoulder as his share.

34 I have taken the breast that is waved and the shoulder that is lifted up from the Israelites, from their peace offering sacrifices, and given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their share forever from the Israelites.

35 This is the part for Aaron and his sons from the fire offerings to God, on the day they were brought to serve God as priests.

36 God ordered this gift from the Israelites to them on the day they were anointed, as a rule to last for all their future generations.

37 This is the rule for the burnt offerings, grain offerings, sin offerings, guilt offerings, dedications, and peace offerings.

38 God told Moses on Mount Sinai to command the Israelites to give their offerings to God when they were in the Sinai wilderness.
