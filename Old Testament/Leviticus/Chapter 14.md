1 God spoke to Moses and said,

2 This will be the rule for the person with leprosy on the day they are cleansed: They must be taken to the priest.

3 The priest will go outside the camp; the priest will look, and if the leprosy sores are healed in the person with leprosy,

4 The priest will order to get for the person to be cleaned two live, clean birds, cedar wood, red fabric, and hyssop.

5 The priest will order that one bird be killed in a clay pot over flowing water.

6 Take the live bird, the cedar wood, the red yarn, and the hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over flowing water.

7 He must sprinkle the person to be cleansed from leprosy seven times, declare him clean, and release the live bird into the open field.

8 The person who needs to be clean must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and bathe in water to become clean. After this, they can return to the camp but must stay outside their tent for seven days.

9 On the seventh day, he must shave all the hair from his head, beard, and eyebrows. He must shave off all his hair, wash his clothes, and bathe in water to be clean.

10 On the eighth day, he must bring two male lambs with no defects, one female lamb less than a year old with no defects, some fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and some oil.

11 The priest who cleans the man will bring him and his offerings to God at the entrance of the meeting tent.

12 The priest will take one male lamb and give it as a guilt offering, along with the oil, and lift them up as an offering before God.

13 He must kill the lamb where he kills the sin and burnt offerings, in the holy place. Like the sin offering belongs to the priest, so does the guilt offering. It is very holy.

14 The priest will take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the top of the right ear, the right thumb, and the right big toe of the person who is being cleansed.

15 The priest will take some of the oil and pour it into his own left hand.

16 The priest will dip his right finger in the oil in his left hand and sprinkle the oil with his finger seven times in front of God.

17 The priest will put the rest of the oil from his hand on the right ear, the right thumb, and the right big toe of the person being cleansed, on top of the blood from the guilt offering.

18 The priest will pour the rest of the oil in his hand on the head of the person being cleansed, and will ask God to forgive him.

19 The priest will offer the sin sacrifice, and make amends for the one being cleansed from his impurity; then he will sacrifice the burnt offering.

20 The priest will offer the burnt and grain offerings on the altar, and the priest will make amends for him, so he will be clean.

21 If he is poor and can't afford much, he must bring one lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to ask for forgiveness for him, and a small amount of fine flour mixed with oil for a food offering, plus a small jug of oil.

22 Bring two doves or two young pigeons, whichever you can afford. One will be for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.

23 He must bring them to the priest at the entrance of the meeting tent for his cleansing on the eighth day, before God.

24 The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the container of oil, and then wave them as an offering before God.

25 He must kill the lamb for the guilt offering. The priest will take some of the lamb's blood and put it on the right ear, right thumb, and right big toe of the person being made clean.

26 The priest will pour some oil into his left hand.

27 The priest will use his right finger to flick some of the oil in his left hand seven times in front of God.

28 The priest will put some of the oil from his hand on the top of the right ear, the right thumb, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being cleansed, where the blood from the guilt offering was put.

29 The priest will put the remaining oil on the head of the person who needs to be made clean to atone for him before God.

30 He must give either one dove or one young pigeon, whatever he can afford.

31 He should bring what he can afford: one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, along with a grain offering. The priest will then make atonement for the person to be cleansed before God.

32 This is the rule for someone who has leprosy but cannot afford the things needed for their cleansing.

33 God spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

34 When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving to you as your own, and I allow a leprosy disease in a house in your land;

35 The homeowner should go and say to the priest, "I think there might be a disease in the house."

36 The priest will order the house to be emptied before the priest enters to inspect the disease, so that everything inside won't become unclean; then the priest will go in to examine the house.

37 He will examine the disease, and, look, if the disease in the house's walls has green or red hollow streaks that appear deeper than the surface;

38 Then the priest will leave the house, go to the door, and close the house for seven days.

39 On the seventh day, the priest will return and check the house. If the disease has spread on the walls,

40 Then the priest will order to remove the stones with the disease and throw them into a dirty place outside the city.

41 He must have the house scraped all around inside, and the scraped-off dust must be dumped outside the city in a dirty place.

42 They will get new stones to replace the old ones, and use fresh mortar to cover the house.

43 If the disease returns and spreads in the house after the stones are removed, the house is scraped, and it is plastered;

44 The priest will come to check, and if the disease has spread in the house, it is a harmful leprosy in the house; it is unclean.

45 He will tear down the house, its stones, wood, and all its plaster, and take them out of the city to a dirty place.

46 Anyone who enters the house while it is closed up will be unclean until evening.

47 Anyone who sleeps in the house must wash their clothes; and anyone who eats in the house must wash their clothes.

48 If the priest enters, sees that the disease has not spread after the house was plastered, then he will declare the house clean because the disease is healed.

49 He must use two birds, cedar wood, scarlet thread, and hyssop to clean the house.

50 He will kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.

51 He must take the cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet cloth, and live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.

52 He will clean the house with the bird's blood, with flowing water, with the live bird, with cedar wood, with hyssop, and with scarlet fabric.

53 He must release the live bird outside the city into the open fields to make up for any wrongs against the house, and then it will be clean.

54 This rule is for every kind of leprosy and skin disease.

55 For the disease of clothes or a house,

56 For swelling, for sores, and for white patches:

57 To teach when something is not clean and when it is clean: this is the rule about leprosy.
