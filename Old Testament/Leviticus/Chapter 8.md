1 God spoke to Moses, saying,

2 Bring Aaron and his sons, their clothes, the anointing oil, a bull for the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of bread without yeast.

3 Bring everyone to the entrance of the meeting tent.

4 Moses did what God told him; and the people came together at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

5 Moses told the people, "This is what God has commanded to be done."

6 Moses took Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.

7 He put the coat on him, tied the belt around him, dressed him in the robe, placed the ephod on him, fastened the beautifully crafted ephod belt, and secured it to him.

8 He put the breastplate on him and placed the Urim and Thummim inside it.

9 He placed the turban on his head and on the turban, right on the front, he put the gold plate, the sacred crown, just as God told Moses.

10 Moses took the special oil and put it on the tent of worship and everything in it to make them holy.

11 He sprinkled it on the altar seven times and put oil on the altar and all its tools, as well as the washbasin and its base, to make them holy.

12 He put anointing oil on Aaron's head and made him holy by anointing him.

13 Moses brought Aaron's sons, dressed them in coats, tied belts around them, and put hats on their heads, just as God told Moses to do.

14 He brought the bull for the sin sacrifice, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on the bull's head for the sin sacrifice.

15 He killed the animal; Moses took the blood, touched it to the altar's horns all around with his finger to cleanse it, then poured the blood at the base of the altar to make it holy, so it could be used for making peace with God.

16 He took all the fat from the insides, the fatty membrane above the liver, both kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.

17 The bull, its skin, meat, and poop, were burned with fire outside the camp, as God told Moses.

18 He presented the ram for the burnt sacrifice, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on the ram's head.

19 He killed it, and Moses splashed the blood around the altar.

20 He cut the ram into pieces, and Moses burned the head, the parts, and the fat.

21 He washed the insides and the legs with water. Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. This was a burnt offering that smelled good, and a fire offering to God, just like God told Moses to do.

22 He brought the second ram, the dedication ram; and Aaron and his sons put their hands on the ram's head.

23 He killed it; Moses took some of its blood and put it on the top of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

24 He brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put some blood on the top of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet; and Moses sprayed the blood around the altar.

25 He took the fat, the back part, all the fat on the insides, the membrane over the liver, both kidneys and their fat, and the right front leg.

26 From the basket of bread without yeast in front of God, he took one piece of unleavened bread, a piece of bread mixed with oil, and one thin cracker, and placed them on the fat and the right shoulder.

27 He placed everything on Aaron's hands and on his sons' hands and waved them as an offering before God.

28 Moses took them from their hands, burned them on the altar with the burnt offering; they were offerings to please God, a fire sacrifice to God.

29 Moses took the chest part of the ram and moved it back and forth as a special offering to God. This was Moses' share from the dedication ram, just as God told Moses to do.

30 Moses took some anointing oil and some blood from the altar, and he sprinkled it on Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes; and this made Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes holy.

31 Moses told Aaron and his sons, "Cook the meat at the entrance of the meeting tent, and eat it there with the bread from the dedication basket, just as I instructed, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'"

32 Burn with fire whatever is left of the meat and bread.

33 Do not leave the entrance of the tent where the meeting is held for seven days, until your dedication time is finished, because you will be set apart for seven days.

34 As he has done today, so God has commanded to be done, to forgive you.

35 Stay by the entrance of the meeting tent day and night for seven days, and follow God's instructions so you won't die, because this is what I've been ordered to tell you.

36 Aaron and his sons did everything that God told them through Moses.
