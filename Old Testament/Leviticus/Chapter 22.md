1 God spoke to Moses, saying,

2 Tell Aaron and his sons to stay away from the holy items of the people of Israel, so they do not disrespect my holy name in those things they dedicate to me: I am God.

3 Tell them, anyone from your descendants, through all your generations, who approaches the sacred items that the Israelites dedicate to God while unclean, that person must be separated from me: I am God.

4 Any descendant of Aaron who has leprosy or a discharge cannot eat the holy food until they are clean. Anyone who touches something unclean because of a dead body or a man's bodily emission;

5 Anyone who touches a crawling creature that might make them unclean, or a person who could pass on their impurity, will also become unclean.

6 The person who touches any such thing will be unclean until evening and must not eat any sacred food unless they wash their body with water.

7 When the sun sets, he will be clean and can then eat the sacred food, because it is his food.

8 He must not eat an animal that died on its own or was killed by other animals, so he will not become unclean; I am God.

9 They must follow my rules so they won't be punished for sinning and die if they disrespect it: I, God, make them holy.

10 No outsider may eat the holy food; only the priest's guest or paid worker may not eat the holy food.

11 If the priest buys someone with his money, both he and those born in his house may eat of it.

12 If the priest's daughter is married to someone outside the community, she cannot eat from the holy offerings.

13 If the priest's daughter is a widow or divorced, without any children, and she goes back to live in her father's home like when she was young, she can eat her father's food. But someone who is not part of the family cannot eat it.

14 If someone eats something holy by mistake, they must add one-fifth more to it and give it to the priest with the holy item.

15 They must not disrespect the sacred gifts of the Israelite people, which they give to God.

16 Do not let them be guilty when they eat their sacred food, for I, God, have made it holy.

17 God spoke to Moses, saying,

18 Talk to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites, and tell them: Anyone from Israel or any foreigner in Israel who wants to present a gift to God for all his promises or any voluntary offerings must offer it to God as a burnt sacrifice.

19 Give freely a perfect male cow, sheep, or goat.

20 Do not offer anything with a flaw, because it will not be accepted on your behalf.

21 Anyone who gives a peace sacrifice to God to keep a promise, or as a voluntary offering of cattle or sheep, must offer one without any faults to be accepted.

22 Do not offer to God animals that are blind, broken, crippled, with warts, with rashes, or with skin diseases, nor burn them as an offering on the altar to God.

23 You may offer a cow or a sheep with extra or missing parts as a voluntary gift to God, but such an animal won't be accepted for a promise.

24 You must not give to God anything that is bruised, crushed, broken, or cut; you also must not make such offerings anywhere in your land.

25 Do not offer to God bread from a stranger's hand, including any of these, for they are corrupt and flawed, and will not be accepted on your behalf.

26 God spoke to Moses, saying,

27 When a cow, sheep, or goat is born, it must stay with its mother for seven days; starting from the eighth day, it can be used for a fire offering to God.

28 Do not kill a cow or sheep and its baby on the same day.

29 When you give a thanksgiving sacrifice to God, do it because you want to.

30 Eat it all on that day; don't save any for the next day: I am God.

31 So you must follow my commands and do them: I am God.

32 Do not disrespect my holy name; instead, I must be honored by the people of Israel: I am God who makes you holy.

33 I brought you out of Egypt to be your God: I am God.
