1 God spoke to Moses, saying,

2 Talk to Aaron, his sons, and all the people of Israel, and tell them this is what God has commanded.

3 Any person from the house of Israel who kills an ox, lamb, or goat, in the camp or outside of it,

4 If someone does not bring their offering to the entrance of the tent where people meet with God to give it to God, he is guilty of taking a life. That person must be excluded from his community.

5 So that the Israelites can bring their sacrifices, which they give in the open fields, to God at the entrance of the meeting tent, to the priest, and offer them for peace to God.

6 The priest will sprinkle the blood on God's altar at the tabernacle entrance and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to God.

7 They will no longer give their sacrifices to demons they chased after. This will be a permanent rule for them for all time.

8 Tell them, "Any Israelite or foreigner staying with you who presents a burnt offering or sacrifice,

9 If someone doesn't bring their offering to the entrance of the meeting tent to present it to God, that person must be separated from their people.

10 Any person from Israel or any foreigner living with you who eats any kind of blood, I will be against them and remove them from their people.

11 Life comes from the blood, and I've given it to you on the altar to forgive your sins because blood brings forgiveness.

12 So I told the Israelites, none of you may eat blood, nor may any outsider living with you eat blood.

13 Any person from Israel or foreigners living with you who hunts and catches an animal or bird that can be eaten must pour out its blood and cover it with dirt.

14 The blood is the life of every creature; it is their lifeblood. So I told the people of Israel not to eat the blood of any creature because the life of every creature is its blood. Anyone who eats it must be removed from the community.

15 Anyone who eats an animal that died on its own or was killed by other animals, whether they are from your country or a foreigner, must wash their clothes and bathe with water. They will be unclean until the evening; then they will be clean.

16 If he doesn't wash them or bathe his body, he must bear his guilt.
