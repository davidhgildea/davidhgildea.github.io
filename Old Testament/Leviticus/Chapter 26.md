1 Do not make any idols or carved images for yourselves, do not set up any sculpted stone figures in your land to bow down to, because I am God, your God.

2 You must keep my rest days and respect my holy place: I am God.

3 If you follow my rules and obey my commands, and follow through with them;

4 I will send rain at the right time, and the land will produce crops, and the trees will bear fruit.

5 Your grain grinding will last until grape picking, and grape picking will last until planting time. You will have plenty of bread to eat and live safely in your land.

6 I will bring peace to the land, and you will rest without fear; I will remove dangerous animals, and no war will enter your land.

7 You will chase your enemies, and they will fall in front of you by the sword.

8 Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand; your enemies will fall by your sword.

9 I will care for you, make you fruitful, increase your numbers, and keep my promise to you.

10 You will eat from your stored food and make room for the new by using up the old.

11 I will put my tent among you, and I will not reject you.

12 I will live with you, be your God, and you will be my people.

13 I am God, who brought you out of Egypt so you wouldn't be slaves; I broke the chains of your burden, so you could walk freely.

14 But if you don't listen to me and don't follow all these commands;

15 If you ignore my laws or hate my rules, and so do not follow all my commands, but break my agreement:

16 I will also do this to you: I will send terror, wasting sickness, and fever that will blind you and make your hearts sad. You will plant seeds for nothing because your enemies will eat your crops.

17 I will be against you, and you will be killed by your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will run away even when no one is chasing you.

18 If you still don't listen to me after all this, I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

19 I will break your power's pride; I will make your sky like iron and your land like brass.

20 You will use all your energy for nothing: your land won't produce crops and the trees won't give fruit.

21 If you act against me and don't listen to me, I will give you seven times more trouble for your sins.

22 I will also send wild animals to attack you, take your children, kill your livestock, and reduce your numbers; your roads will be empty.

23 If you don't change your ways because of these things but continue to oppose me;

24 Then I will also go against you and punish you seven times more for your sins.

25 I will send a sword against you to punish you for breaking my agreement. When you are together in your cities, I will bring disease among you, and you will be given over to your enemies.

26 When I make your bread supply scarce, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will give you your bread in measured amounts: you will eat but still be hungry.

27 If you still don't listen to me and choose to go against my ways;

28 Then I will act against you in anger; and I will punish you seven times for your sins.

29 You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.

30 I will destroy your worship places, cut down your statues, throw your dead bodies on your idols' dead bodies, and I will hate you.

31 I will turn your cities into ruins, destroy your holy places, and I will not enjoy the scent of your offerings.

32 I will make the land empty, and your enemies living there will be shocked by it.

33 I will spread you among the nations, and I will chase you with a sword: and your land will be empty, and your cities ruined.

34 The land will have its rest days while it's empty, and you are in your enemies' land; the land will rest and have its rest days.

35 As long as it is empty, it will rest; because it didn't rest during your Sabbaths when you lived on it.

36 I will make those of you who survive feel weak in heart in their enemies' lands; even the sound of a blowing leaf will scare them. They will run away as if running from a sword and they will fall, even though no one is chasing them.

37 They will stumble over each other as if fleeing from a sword, even when no one is chasing them; and you will be unable to resist your enemies.

38 You will die in foreign lands, and your enemies' land will consume you.

39 Those of you who survive will waste away in your enemies' lands because of your sins and your ancestors' sins.

40 If they admit their wrongs, and their ancestors' wrongs, and their betrayal against me, and that they have also acted against me;

41 I have opposed them and led them into their enemies' land. If their stubborn hearts are humble and they accept their punishment,

42 Then I will remember my promise to Jacob, to Isaac, and to Abraham, and I will remember the land.

43 The land will be abandoned by them and will rest during its sabbaths while it's empty without them; and they will accept their punishment for their sins because they hated my laws and their hearts rejected my rules.

44 Even then, when they are in their enemies' land, I won't reject them or hate them enough to completely destroy them and break my promise to them, because I am their God.

45 But for their sake, I will remember the agreement with their ancestors, who I freed from Egypt for all to see, so I could be their God: I am God.

46 These are the rules, decisions, and laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai through Moses.
