1 God called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent where people gather, saying,

2 Talk to the people of Israel and tell them: If anyone wants to give an offering to God, it should be a farm animal from the herd or flock.

3 If he brings a burnt offering from the herd, it must be a flawless male. He must present it by his own choice at the entrance of the meeting tent before God.

4 He must place his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to forgive him.

5 He must kill the bull before God, and Aaron's sons, the priests, will take the blood and sprinkle it all around the altar near the tent of meeting's entrance.

6 He will remove the skin of the burned offering and cut it into pieces.

7 Aaron's sons, who are priests, will put fire on the altar and arrange the wood on the fire.

8 The priests, who are Aaron's sons, will place the pieces, the head, and the fat on the wood that is burning on the altar.

9 He must wash its inner parts and legs with water. Then the priest will burn everything on the altar as a burnt offering, a fire-made offering with a pleasing aroma to God.

10 If his sacrifice comes from the flock, from the sheep or goats, for a burnt offering, he must present a male without defects.

11 He will kill the offering on the north side of the altar in front of God, and Aaron's sons, the priests, will sprinkle its blood all around on the altar.

12 He will cut it into pieces, including the head and the fat, and the priest will arrange them on the wood that is burning on the altar.

13 He must wash the insides and legs with water: then the priest must take and burn it all on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a fire-offering, with a pleasing aroma to God.

14 If his burnt offering to God is birds, he must bring turtledoves or young pigeons.

15 The priest will take it to the altar, remove its head, and burn it on the altar. The blood will be drained at the side of the altar.

16 He will remove its stomach and its feathers and throw them near the altar on the east side, at the place for ashes.

17 He should split it to its wings, but not cut it completely. The priest will burn it on the altar with wood on the fire. It is a burnt offering, a fire sacrifice, that smells good to God.
