1 Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, each took a censer, added fire and incense, and offered unauthorized fire to God, which He had not instructed them to do.

2 Fire came from God, consumed them, and they died in God's presence.

3 Then Moses told Aaron, "This is what God said, 'I must be honored by those who come close to me, and I must be respected in front of all the people.'" And Aaron was quiet.

4 Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, Uzziel's sons and Aaron's nephews, and said to them, "Come here, take your brothers away from in front of the holy place, out of the camp."

5 They went close and took them outside the camp in their coats, just as Moses had instructed.

6 Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, "Do not uncover your heads or tear your clothes, so you will not die and so anger will not come upon everyone. But let your relatives, all the people of Israel, mourn the fire that God has started."

7 Do not leave the entrance of the meeting tent, or you will die, because God's special oil is on you. They did as Moses said.

8 God spoke to Aaron, saying,

9 Do not drink wine or strong drink, you or your sons, when you enter the meeting tent, so you don't die. This rule is forever for all your descendants.

10 So you can tell what is holy from what is not, and what is clean from what is unclean.

11 So you can teach the Israelites all the rules that God has given them through Moses.

12 Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his remaining sons, "Take the leftover grain offering from God's fire offerings and eat it without yeast near the altar, because it is very holy."

13 You must eat it in the sacred place, because it is your share and your sons' share from God's sacrifices made by fire: this is what I am told to do.

14 Eat the waved breast and the raised shoulder in a clean place; you, your sons, and your daughters with you. These are your share and your sons' share from the peace offerings of the people of Israel.

15 Bring the lifted shoulder and the waved chest along with the burned fat offerings to present as a waved offering before God; it will be yours and your sons' forever, as God has ordered.

16 Moses carefully looked for the goat for the sin sacrifice and saw it was burned. He was mad at Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons who were still alive, and said,

17 Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the holy area when it is very holy, and God has given it to you to take away the people's sins and make them right with God?

18 Look, its blood was not taken into the holy place; you should have eaten it there, as I instructed.

19 Aaron said to Moses, "Look, today they gave their sin offering and burnt offering to God. Such things have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been okay with God?"

20 When Moses heard it, he was happy.
