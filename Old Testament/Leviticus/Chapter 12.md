1 God spoke to Moses, saying,

2 Talk to the Israelites and say, if a woman has a baby and it is a boy, she will be unclean for seven days, just like when she is on her period.

3 On the eighth day, the skin of his private part should be cut.

4 She must then wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the holy place until her purification period is over.

5 If she gives birth to a girl, she will be unclean for two weeks like during her period. She will stay in the blood of her cleansing for 66 days.

6 When the time of her cleansing for a son or daughter is complete, she must bring a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or dove for a sin offering to the entrance of the meeting tent, to the priest.

7 Who will present it to God and provide a sacrifice for her; she will then be purified from her bleeding. This is the rule for a woman who has given birth to a boy or a girl.

8 If she can't afford a lamb, she must bring two doves or two young pigeons; one for a sacrifice to honor God, and the other for a sin offering. The priest will perform a ceremony to forgive her sins, and then she will be pure.
