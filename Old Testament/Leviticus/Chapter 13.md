1 God spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

2 When a person has a swelling, a rash, or a shiny spot on their skin that may be a sign of leprosy, they must go to Aaron the priest or one of his sons who are priests.

3 The priest will check the skin disease: if the hair turns white and the disease seems deeper than the skin, it is leprosy. The priest will see this and say the person is not clean.

4 If there's a white bright spot on the skin and it's not deeper than the skin and the hair hasn't turned white, the priest must isolate the person with the sickness for seven days.

5 On the seventh day, the priest will examine the person, and if the disease has not spread and is not active, the priest will isolate the person for another seven days.

6 On the seventh day, the priest will look at the person again. If the infection looks darker and hasn't spread on the skin, the priest will say they are clean. It's only a scab. Then they must wash their clothes and they will be clean.

7 If the scab spreads widely on the skin after the priest has checked him for being clean, the priest must examine him again.

8 If the priest sees the scab spreading on the skin, the priest must say he is unclean because it is leprosy.

9 If a man has leprosy, he must go to the priest.

10 The priest must look at him, and if there's a white swelling on the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is fresh, red skin in the swelling.

11 The skin disease is serious and old, and the priest will say he is unclean; he won't isolate him because he is already unclean.

12 If someone's skin breaks out with leprosy all over from head to foot, wherever the priest checks;

13 The priest will look, and if the skin disease has spread over all the person's skin, he will declare the person with the disease clean because it has all become white; the person is clean.

14 But if he sees raw flesh, he must be considered unclean.

15 The priest will look at the sore skin and say it is not clean: because sore skin is not clean: it is a disease.

16 If the sore heals and turns white, he should go to the priest.

17 The priest will look at the person and if the disease has become white, the priest will declare that the person with the disease is clean.

18 If someone had a boil on their skin and it healed,

19 If there's a white swelling or a bright white and reddish spot where the boil was, show it to the priest.

20 If the priest sees that the mark looks deeper than the skin and the hair in it has turned white, the priest must say the person is unclean. It is a case of leprosy that has come from the sore.

21 If the priest sees it and there are no white hairs, and it's not below the skin but a bit dark, then the priest must isolate him for seven days.

22 If it spreads a lot on the skin, then the priest must say he is not clean: it is a disease.

23 If the bright spot stays the same and does not spread, it is a healed boil; the priest will say he is clean.

24 If there is a burning sore on someone's skin and the healed part turns white or reddish-white.

25 The priest will look at it, and if the hair in the bright area has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy that has come from the sore. So, the priest will say he is not clean; it is leprosy.

26 If the priest sees the spot and there is no white hair in it, if it's not deeper than the skin but is dark, then the priest will isolate the person for seven days.

27 On the seventh day, the priest will examine him, and if the skin infection has spread widely, the priest will declare him unclean because it is leprosy.

28 If the shiny spot stays the same and does not spread on the skin, but gets a little darker, it is a scar from the burn. The priest will say he is clean because it is just the swelling from the burn.

29 If a man or woman has a disease on their head or beard;

30 The priest will look at the sore, and if it is deeper than the skin and has a thin yellow hair, the priest will declare the person unclean. It is a dry scaly infection, a form of leprosy on the head or beard.

31 If the priest sees the scall infection and it's not deeper than the skin, and there's no black hair in it, then the priest will quarantine the person with the scall infection for seven days.

32 On the seventh day, the priest will examine the sore. If it hasn't spread, there's no yellow hair, and it's not deeper than the skin,

33 He must shave his hair, but not the scall. The priest will isolate the person with the scall for another seven days.

34 On the seventh day, the priest will check the scall. If the scall has not spread on the skin or looks deep, the priest will say he is clean. Then he must wash his clothes and will be clean.

35 If the rash spreads on the skin after he is cleaned;

36 The priest will look at him and if the scall has spread on the skin, the priest won't look for yellow hair; he is unclean.

37 If the sore hasn't spread and black hair has grown in it, the sore is healed and the person is clean; the priest will declare them clean.

38 If a man or woman has shiny white spots on their skin;

39 Then the priest will look, and if there are light white spots on their skin, it's just a common freckle; they are clean.

40 If a man loses his hair and becomes bald, he is still clean.

41 Anyone whose hair has fallen out from the front of their head is bald on the forehead but is still clean.

42 If there is a white and red sore on the bald head or forehead, it is leprosy that has developed on the bald spot.

43 The priest will look at it, and if there is a white-red swelling on his bald head or forehead, it is like leprosy on the skin.

44 He has leprosy and is not clean. The priest must say he is completely not clean; his disease is on his head.

45 The person with leprosy who has the sickness must tear their clothes, leave their head uncovered, cover their upper lip, and shout, "Unclean, unclean."

46 Every day the sickness is in him, he is unclean and must live alone outside the camp.

47 The piece of clothing that has leprosy, whether it is made of wool or linen;

48 Whether it's in the threads, in linen, in wool, in leather, or in anything made of leather;

49 If the infection on the clothes or skin looks green or red, whether on the threads or in the fabric or on something made of skin, it is a sign of leprosy and must be shown to the priest.

50 The priest will examine the disease and isolate the affected person for seven days.

51 On the seventh day, he will check the disease. If the disease has spread in the fabric, whether the threads or the weave, or in leather, or in anything made of leather, the disease is a harmful skin condition; it is not clean.

52 He must burn the clothing, whether it is woven or knitted from wool or linen, or made of leather, if it has the disease on it. It is a persistent infection and must be burned with fire.

53 If the priest looks and sees the disease has not spread in the cloth, whether woven or knitted, or in anything made of leather;

54 The priest will order them to wash the item with the disease, and he will isolate it for another seven days.

55 The priest will look at the sickness after washing it. If the sickness hasn't changed color or spread, it's not clean. You must burn it because the disease is deep, whether it shows on the inside or outside.

56 If the priest sees that the spot is darker after it has been washed, he must cut it out of the fabric, leather, or woven or knitted material.

57 If the problem remains in the cloth, whether in the threads or in anything made of skin, it is a spreading disease: you must burn the infected item with fire.

58 If you wash a piece of clothing, whether woven or knitted, or any leather item, and the disease goes away, you must wash it again and then it will be clean.

59 This is the rule for a disease like leprosy in clothes made of wool or linen, whether in the threads or in anything made of skin, to say if it is clean or not clean.
