1 If his gift is a peace offering sacrifice from the cattle, whether male or female, he must present one without any defects to God.

2 He must put his hand on the head of his offering and kill it at the entrance of the meeting tent. Then the sons of Aaron, who are priests, will splash its blood on all sides of the altar.

3 He must present part of the peace offering as a fire offering to God; this includes the fat covering the inner parts and all the fat on the inner parts.

4 Take out the two kidneys and the fat on them near the flanks, as well as the fatty membrane over the liver along with the kidneys.

5 Aaron's sons will burn it on the altar with the burnt offering that is on top of the wood on the fire. This is a fire offering with a pleasing smell to God.

6 If someone presents a peace offering to God from the flock, whether male or female, it must be without any defects.

7 If he gives a lamb as his offering, he must present it to God.

8 He must put his hand on his offering's head and kill it in front of the meeting tent; and Aaron's sons must splash its blood all around on the altar.

9 He must present part of the peace offering as a burnt offering to God; the fat and the entire tail must be removed close to the backbone, along with the fat covering the internal organs and all the fat on the organs.

10 God wants the two kidneys and the fat on them, near the belly, and the layer on the liver to be removed along with the kidneys.

11 The priest will burn it on the altar; it is the food for the fire offering to God.

12 If he brings a goat as his offering, then he must present it before God.

13 He will put his hand on its head and kill it in front of the meeting tent. Aaron's sons will splash its blood on the sides of the altar.

14 He must present his sacrifice to God, a burnt offering; the fat covering the inner parts and all the fat on the internal organs.

15 Take out the two kidneys and the fat on them near the flanks, and the layer on the liver along with the kidneys.

16 The priest will burn them on the altar; this is the food of the fire offering that smells sweet: all the fat belongs to God.

17 This rule will always apply to all your future families wherever you live: you must not eat fat or blood.
