1 God spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

2 Tell the people of Israel, if a man has a discharge from his body, he is unclean because of it.

3 This is how he will be unclean with his discharge: whether his body has a flow or is blocked from his flow, it is his uncleanness.

4 Every bed he lies on with the discharge is unclean, and everything he sits on will be unclean.

5 Anyone who touches his bed must wash their clothes, take a bath, and they will be unclean until evening.

6 Whoever sits on anything the person with the discharge sat on must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean until evening.

7 Anyone who touches the skin of the person with the discharge must wash their clothes, take a bath, and will be unclean until evening.

8 If someone with a discharge spits on a clean person, the clean person must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.

9 Any saddle that a person with a discharge rides on will be unclean.

10 Anyone who touches anything that was beneath the dead person will be unclean until evening; whoever carries any of those things must wash their clothes and bathe in water, and they will be unclean until evening.

11 Anyone who touches the person with the discharge without having washed their hands must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and will be unclean until evening.

12 If someone with the discharge touches a clay pot, it must be broken, and any wooden object must be washed with water.

13 When a person with a discharge is healed, they must count seven days for their cleansing, wash their clothes, and bathe in flowing water to be clean.

14 On the eighth day, he must bring two doves or two young pigeons to God at the entrance of the meeting tent and give them to the priest.

15 The priest will sacrifice them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest will ask God to forgive him for his problem.

16 If a man's semen comes out, he must wash his whole body with water and will be unclean until evening.

17 Every piece of clothing and every skin touched by bodily fluids must be washed with water, and will be unclean until evening.

18 The woman and the man who have sexual relations must both wash with water and will be unclean until evening.

19 If a woman has a discharge, and it is blood from her body, she must be separated for seven days. Anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening.

20 Everything she lies on during her period will be unclean, and everything she sits on will be unclean too.

21 Anyone who touches her bed must wash their clothes, take a bath, and will be unclean until evening.

22 Anyone who touches anything she sat on must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will be unclean until evening.

23 If it's on her bed or anything she sits on, when he touches it, he will be unclean until evening.

24 If a man sleeps with a woman during her period, he will be unclean for seven days, and any bed he lies on will also be unclean.

25 If a woman bleeds for many days, not at the time of her period, or if her bleeding lasts longer than her period, she will be unclean as long as she has this bleeding, just like during her period.

26 Every bed she lies on during her period will be like her bed during her separation time; and anything she sits on will be unclean, like the uncleanness of her separation.

27 Anyone who touches those things will be unclean. They must wash their clothes, bathe in water, and stay unclean until evening.

28 If she is healed from her condition, she must count seven days for herself, and then she will be clean.

29 On the eighth day, she must take two doves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the meeting tent.

30 The priest will offer one as a sin sacrifice and the other as a burnt offering; the priest will make amends for her with God for her unclean condition.

31 You must help the Israelites stay clean; if they are unclean, they could die, especially if they make my dwelling place among them unclean.

32 This is the rule for someone with a bodily discharge, and for a man who has an emission of semen, making him unclean.

33 About a woman during her menstrual cycle, and anyone with a discharge, whether male or female, and anyone who has sexual contact with someone who is unclean.
