</div>
1 God spoke to Moses, saying,

2 Tell the people of Israel, 'I am God, your God.'

3 Do not follow the customs of Egypt where you lived, nor the customs of Canaan where I am taking you. Do not follow their rules.

4 Follow my rules and keep my laws, and live by them. I am God, your God.

5 You must follow my rules and decisions: if a person does this, they will have a good life by them: I am God.

6 None of you should come close to a relative to see them naked: I am God.

7 Do not see your father's or your mother's naked body; she is your mother, so do not look at her nakedness.

8 Do not see your father's wife undressed; she is your father's privacy.

9 Do not see the private parts of your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether she was born in the same house or elsewhere.

10 Do not see the private parts of your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter; their privacy is your privacy.

11 Do not have sexual relations with your stepsister, the daughter of your father's wife; she is your sister.

12 Do not see your father's sister without clothes; she is your father's close relative.

13 Do not see your aunt undressed; she is your mother's close relative.

14 Do not see your uncle's nakedness or be close to his wife; she is your aunt.

15 Do not see your daughter-in-law without clothes; she is your son's wife; do not see her without clothes.

16 Do not see your brother's wife without clothes; it is like seeing your brother without clothes.

17 Do not see a woman and her daughter or her granddaughter naked; it is wrong because they are close relatives.

18 Do not marry your wife's sister while your wife is alive, to cause her trouble by having both of them.

19 Also, do not go near a woman to see her without clothes while she is set apart during her monthly period.

20 Do not have sex with your neighbor's wife and make yourself impure.

21 Do not let any of your children be burned in sacrifice to Molech, and do not dishonor your God's name: I am God.

22 Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; it is disgusting.

23 Do not have sexual relations with any animal; it makes you unclean. A woman must not offer herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; this is a perversion.

24 Do not make yourselves unclean with any of these actions; for by all these things, the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean.

25 The land is dirty: so I punish its wrongs, and the land throws out its people.

26 You must follow my laws and decisions, and must not do any of these disgusting thingsâ€”neither anyone from your people nor any foreigner living with you.

27 The people who lived in the land before you did all these terrible things, and they made the land unclean.

28 So that the land does not vomit you out when you make it dirty, as it vomited out the nations before you.

29 Anyone who does any of these disgusting things will be separated from their community.

30 So you must follow my rules and not do any of these disgusting things that were done before you, so you do not become unclean by them: I am God, your God.
