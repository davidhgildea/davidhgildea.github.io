1 If a person sins, hears someone swear an oath, and is a witness, knowing or seeing what happened, but doesn't speak up, then that person will be guilty.

2 If someone touches anything dirty, like the dead body of an unclean animal, or dead unclean livestock, or dead unclean crawling creatures, without realizing it, that person will be unclean and guilty.

3 If he touches anything unclean relating to a person, any kind of human uncleanness, and is not aware of it but later realizes it, he is guilty.

4 If someone promises to do something bad or good without realizing it, and later they understand what they promised, they are responsible for their promise.

5 When he realizes his guilt in any of these matters, he must admit that he has sinned.

6 He must bring a guilt offering to God for the sin he committed, either a female sheep or goat, for a sin sacrifice; and the priest will make amends for his sin.

7 If he can't afford a lamb, he must bring two doves or two young pigeons to God for his guiltâ€”one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.

8 He must take them to the priest, who will sacrifice the sin offering first, then twist off its head without separating it from the body.

9 He must sprinkle some of the sin offering's blood on the altar's side; the rest of the blood must be poured out at the altar's base: it is a sin offering.

10 He must present the second as a burnt offering in the right way. The priest will perform a ritual to forgive his sin, and he will be forgiven.

11 If he can't afford two doves or two young pigeons, the person who sinned must bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. He must not add oil or frankincense to it because it is a sin offering.

12 He must take it to the priest, and the priest will grab a handful of it as a reminder and burn it on the altar as a fire offering to God; it is an offering for sin.

13 The priest will make up for his sin that he sinned in one of these cases, and he will be forgiven; the leftover will belong to the priest, like a food offering.

14 God spoke to Moses, saying,

15 If someone does something wrong by mistake against the sacred things of God, they must bring a perfect ram from their flock, estimated in silver shekels according to the holy standards, as a penalty offering to God.

16 He must pay for the damage he did to the sacred things, add one-fifth more, and give it to the priest. The priest will use the ram for the guilt offering to make things right for him, and he will be forgiven.

17 If someone sins and does something God's commands say not to do, even if they didn't know it, they're still guilty and must accept the consequences.

18 He must bring a perfect ram from the flock, valued by you, for a guilt offering to the priest. The priest will perform a ritual to make up for his mistake which he did without knowing, and he will be forgiven.

19 It is a guilt offering: he has truly done wrong against God.
