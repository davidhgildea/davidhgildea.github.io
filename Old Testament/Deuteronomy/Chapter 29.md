1 These are the words of the agreement that God told Moses to create with the people of Israel in Moab, in addition to the agreement he made with them at Horeb.

2 Moses spoke to all Israel, saying, "You have seen everything God did in Egypt to Pharaoh, his officials, and his land right before your eyes."

3 The big tests you saw, the signs, and amazing wonders.

4 But God has not given you a mind to understand, or eyes to see, or ears to hear, until today.

5 I have guided you for forty years in the desert: your clothes have not worn out, and your shoes have not worn out on your feet.

6 You haven't eaten bread or drunk wine or strong alcohol so that you may know that I am God.

7 When you arrived here, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan fought against us, and we defeated them.

8 We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

9 So, keep and follow the words of this agreement, so you can succeed in everything you do.

10 Today, all of you are standing before God; your leaders, your elders, and your officials, along with every man from Israel.

11 Your children, your wives, and any outsiders living among you, from those who cut your wood to those who draw your water:

12 You should agree to a commitment with God, and to His promise, which God makes with you today.

13 So that today he may make you his own people, and be your God, just as he promised you, and as he pledged to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

14 I am making this promise and agreement not just with you.

15 But with everyone here today in front of God, and with those who are not here with us today.

16 You know how we lived in Egypt and how we traveled through the countries you went by.

17 You have seen their disgusting idols, made of wood, stone, silver, and gold, that were with them.

18 Make sure no one among you—man, woman, family, or group—turns away from God today to worship the gods of other lands. Make sure there's no one among you that grows bitter and poisonous like a harmful plant.

19 When he hears the words of this curse, he might tell himself he will be okay, even though he follows his own stubborn desires, leading to more and more wrong.

20 God will not forgive him, but then God's anger and jealousy will burn against that man, and all the curses written in this book will fall on him, and God will erase his name from under heaven.

21 God will set him apart for harm from all the tribes of Israel, following all the curses of the agreement written in this book of the law.

22 So that future generations of your children and newcomers from distant lands will ask, when they see the disasters and diseases that God has brought on the land;

23 The whole land is full of sulfur, salt, and ash, nothing can be planted, nothing grows, and no grass sprouts, just like when God destroyed Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim in his anger and fury.

24 All nations will ask, "Why has God acted this way towards this land? What does this fierce anger mean?"

25 People will say, "It's because they left the agreement with God that their ancestors had, which he made with them when he took them out of Egypt."

26 They left and served different gods, and bowed to them, gods they didn't know, and that God hadn't given to them.

27 God became very angry with this land and decided to bring all the curses written in this book upon it.

28 In anger, wrath, and deep displeasure, God removed them from their land and threw them into another land, where they are to this day.

29 Hidden things are for God, but what is shown is for us and our kids forever, so we can follow all of this law.
