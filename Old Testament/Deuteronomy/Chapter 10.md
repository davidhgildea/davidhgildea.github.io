1 At that time, God told me, "Cut two stone tablets like the first ones and come up the mountain to meet me, and make a wooden box."

2 I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you must put them in the chest.

3 I made a box from acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first ones. Then I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.

4 He wrote on the tablets the same ten commandments that God told you on the mountain from the fire on the day we all gathered, and God gave them to me.

5 I turned around and came down the mountain, and placed the tablets in the chest I had built; and there they are, as God told me.

6 The Israelites traveled from Beeroth, where Jaakan's people lived, to Mosera. Aaron died and was buried there, and his son Eleazar became the priest in his place.

7 They traveled from there to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land with many water streams.

8 At that time, God chose the tribe of Levi to carry the covenant box, to serve before God, to take care of his needs, and to bless people in his name, which continues even now.

9 So Levi does not have a share or property like his brothers; God is his share, just as God promised him.

10 I stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, like before; and God listened to me again, and did not decide to destroy you.

11 God told me, "Get up, lead the way for the people, so they can enter and take over the land that I promised to give to their ancestors."

12 Now, Israel, what does God your God ask of you but to respect God, to live in His ways, to love Him, and to serve God with all your heart and all your soul?

13 To follow God's commands and rules, which I give you today for your benefit?

14 Look, the sky and even the highest heavens belong to God, and so does the earth and everything in it.

15 God was pleased with your ancestors and loved them, so he chose you, their descendants, above all others, as it is today.

16 Cut away the stubbornness from your heart, and don't be stubborn anymore.

17 Your God is the greatest God and the highest leader, a big and strong God who treats everyone the same and doesn't take bribes.

18 He carries out justice for orphans and widows, and loves foreigners, by giving them food and clothing.

19 Love the foreigner, because you were foreigners in Egypt.

20 You should respect God; serve him, stay close to him, and make promises in his name.

21 He is the one you praise, and he is your God who has done these great and frightening things for you that you have seen.

22 Your ancestors went to Egypt with seventy people; and now God has made you as many as the stars in the sky.
