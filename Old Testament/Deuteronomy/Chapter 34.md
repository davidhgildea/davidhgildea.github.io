1 Moses went up from the Moab plains to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. God showed him all the land of Gilead, as far as Dan.

2 All Naphtali, Ephraim's land, Manasseh, and all Judah's land, up to the farthest sea,

3 To the south, the flat land of Jericho's valley, the city with palm trees, up to Zoar.

4 God said to him, "This is the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I said I would give it to your descendants. I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over into it."

5 Moses, God's servant, died in Moab as God said.

6 He buried him in a valley in Moab, near Bethpeor, but no one knows his grave location to this day.

7 Moses was 120 years old when he died; his eyesight was still clear, and he was still strong.

8 The Israelites cried for Moses in the Moab plains for thirty days; after that, the time for crying and grieving for Moses was over.

9 Joshua, son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had put his hands on him; so, the Israelites listened to him and did what God had told Moses.

10 No prophet like Moses has since appeared in Israel, someone whom God knew personally.

11 In all the miracles and amazing things that God told him to do in Egypt, to Pharaoh, his officials, and his whole country,

12 And with all the power and amazing acts that Moses performed for all Israel to see.
