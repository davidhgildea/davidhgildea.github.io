1 The destroyer has come before you: guard the fortress, watch the road, strengthen your waist, and power up greatly.

2 God has taken away Jacob's greatness, just like Israel's; because the enemies have stripped them bare and ruined their vine branches.

3 The warriors' shields are red, the brave wear red clothes: on the day of battle, the chariots will blaze with fire, and the evergreen trees will shake violently.

4 Chariots will speed through the streets, bumping into each other on wide roads; they will look like bright torches and move as fast as lightning.

5 He will list his brave men: they will trip as they walk; they will rush to its wall, and the protection will be set up.

6 The river gates will be opened, and the palace will fall apart.

7 Huzzab will be captured and taken away; she will be led by her maids who sound like cooing doves, beating on their chests.

8 Nineveh is an ancient city like a water pond, but its people will run away. "Stop, stop," they will shout, but no one will turn around.

9 Take the silver loot, take the gold loot; there is no end to the riches and beauty from all the nice things.

10 It is empty and ruined and destroyed; hearts are faint, knees knock, all hips hurt, and every face grows pale.

11 Where is the home of the lions and the place where the young lions eat, where the lion, the old lion, walked, and the lion's cub, without fear?

12 The lion tore enough for his cubs, choked food for his lionesses, and filled his lairs with prey, and his dens with torn animals.

13 Look, I am against you, says God, and I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword will kill your young lions: I will take away your hunted animals from the land, and no one will hear your messengers anymore.
