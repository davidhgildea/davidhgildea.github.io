1 The message about Nineveh. The vision that Nahum from Elkosh saw.

2 God is jealous, and God takes revenge; God takes revenge and is very angry; God will punish those against him, and he keeps anger for his enemies.

3 God is patient, very strong, and does not let the guilty go free. God moves in the tornado and the storm, and the clouds are like the dust under his feet.

4 He scolds the sea, makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan and Carmel wither, and the flowers of Lebanon also wither.

5 Mountains shake before him, hills dissolve, and the earth burns at his arrival, including the world and everyone living in it.

6 Who can withstand his anger? Who can endure his fierce rage? His fury is unleashed like fire, and he shatters rocks.

7 God is good, a safe place in times of trouble; and he knows those who trust in him.

8 With a sweeping flood, he will completely destroy that place, and darkness will chase his enemies.

9 What are you planning against God? He will completely end it; trouble will not happen again.

10 While they are tangled like thorns and drunk like drunkards, they will be consumed like completely dry straw.

11 Someone from among you plans evil against God, a wicked advisor.

12 God says, "Even if they are calm and many, they will be cut down when he comes through. Though I have caused you trouble, I will not do it anymore."

13 I will now break his control over you and tear apart your chains.

14 God has commanded that your name will no longer spread. I will destroy the carved and metal idols from your temple. I will prepare your grave because you are wicked.

15 Look at the mountainsâ€”the feet of the one who brings good news and announces peace! O Judah, celebrate your festivals and keep your promises: the evil one will not invade you again; he is completely defeated.
