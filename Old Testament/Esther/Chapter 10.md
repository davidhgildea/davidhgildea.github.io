1 The king Ahasuerus put a tax on the land and the islands of the sea.

2 Every powerful act and every display of his strength, along with the story of how great Mordecai became, which the king recognized, are all recorded in the history book of the kings of Media and Persia, aren't they?

3 Mordecai the Jew was close to King Ahasuerus, respected by many Jews, and he looked after the well-being of his people and promoted peace among them.
