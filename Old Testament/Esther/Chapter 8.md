1 On that day, King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Mordecai came to the king because Esther had explained who he was to her.

2 The king removed his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther made Mordecai in charge of Haman's property.

3 Esther spoke to the king again, knelt at his feet, and cried, asking him to stop the evil plans of Haman the Agagite against the Jews.

4 The king reached out his gold staff to Esther. Then Esther got up and stood in front of the king.

5 She said, "If the king agrees and I have his favor, if he thinks it's the right thing to do and he is pleased with me, let an order be made to cancel the plans Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, made. He wrote these plans to kill the Jews in all the king's lands."

6 How can I bear to see the harm that will happen to my people, or watch my relatives be destroyed?

7 Then King Ahasuerus told Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, "Look, I have given Esther Haman's house, and they have hanged him because he attacked the Jews."

8 Write a letter for the Jews in the king's name as you wish, and seal it with the king's ring, because no one can change a letter written and sealed with the king's ring.

9 The king's writers were called in the third month, the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day. Everything Mordecai ordered was written for the Jews, the officials, and the leaders of the 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia. Each province got the order in its own script and language, and so did the Jews in their script and language.

10 He wrote in King Ahasuerus' name, sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by messengers on horseback and riders on mules, camels, and young camels.

11 The king allowed the Jews in every city to unite and defend their lives, to kill and eliminate any group or region that attacked them, including children and women, and to take their belongings as loot.

12 On one day in all the areas ruled by King Ahasuerus, specifically on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar.

13 The text of the order to be announced in every province was made known to everyone, so the Jews could prepare to defend themselves against their enemies on that day.

14 The messengers who rode on mules and camels left quickly, pushed by the king's order, and the law was announced in Shushan the palace.

15 Mordecai left the king dressed in blue and white royal clothes, with a big gold crown, and clothes of good linen and purple. The city of Shushan was happy and glad.

16 The Jews had brightness, happiness, joy, and respect.

17 In every region and city where the king's orders reached, the Jews felt joy and happiness, celebrated with a feast, and had a good day. Many local people became Jews because they were afraid of the Jews.
