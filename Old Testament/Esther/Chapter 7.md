1 The king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther.

2 The king spoke to Queen Esther again on the second day during the wine banquet, asking, "What do you wish for, Queen Esther? It will be given to you. What do you want to ask for? It will be done, up to half of the kingdom."

3 Queen Esther answered, "If I have pleased you, O king, and if you wish, please spare my life and save my people, as I have asked."

4 My people and I are sold to be killed and wiped out. If we were just sold as slaves, I would be quiet, even though the loss wouldn't make up for the king's loss.

5 Then King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who dared to do this in his heart?"

6 Esther said, "This evil Haman is our enemy." Then Haman became scared in front of the king and queen.

7 The king, angry after his wine feast, went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to beg Queen Esther to save his life, for he knew the king intended harm against him.

8 Then the king came back from the palace garden to the wine banquet room, and he saw Haman lying on the couch where Esther was. The king asked, "Is he trying to attack the queen right here in front of me in the palace?" As soon as the king finished speaking, they covered Haman's face.

9 Harbonah, one of the king's servants, said to the king, "Look, there are the gallows, fifty cubits tall, which Haman built for Mordecai, who had spoken well of the king, standing at Haman's house." Then the king said, "Hang him on it."

10 They hung Haman on the same gallows he built for Mordecai. This calmed the king's anger.
