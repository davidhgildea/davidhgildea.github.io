1 After these events, during King Artaxerxes' rule of Persia, Ezra, who was Seraiah's son, Azariah's grandson, and Hilkiah's great-grandson,

2 The son of Shallum was Zadok's son, and Zadok was Ahitub's son.

3 He was Amariah's son, Azariah's grandson, and Meraioth's great-grandson.

4 Zerahiah's son, Uzzi's son, Bukki's son,

5 Abishua's son, Phinehas's son, Eleazar's son, Aaron the high priest's son.

6 Ezra left Babylon; he was a skilled writer in Moses' law, which God of Israel had given. The king gave him everything he asked for because God's favor was with him.

7 Some Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Nethinim went up to Jerusalem in King Artaxerxes' seventh year.

8 He arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king's rule.

9 He started to leave Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month because God was helping him.

10 Ezra had made up his mind to study God's law, follow it, and teach God's rules and decisions in Israel.

11 This is the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest and scribe, who writes down God's commands and laws for Israel.

12 King Artaxerxes to Ezra the priest, a writer skilled in the law of God in heaven, wishes perfect peace.

13 I issue an order that all Israelites, priests, and Levites in my kingdom who want to go to Jerusalem may go with you.

14 Since the king and his seven advisors sent you to find out about Judah and Jerusalem according to your God's law that you have with you;

15 To bring the silver and gold, which the king and his advisors have willingly given to the God of Israel, who lives in Jerusalem.

16 Take all the silver and gold you can find in the whole Babylon area, along with the voluntary gifts from the people and priests given freely for their God's temple in Jerusalem.

17 Use this money to quickly buy bulls, rams, lambs, their grain offerings, and their drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of God's house in Jerusalem.

18 Do whatever you and your brothers think is best with the remaining silver and gold, according to God's will.

19 Give the tools provided for the work of your God's house to God in Jerusalem.

20 Whatever else you need for God's house, give it from the king's treasury.

21 I, King Artaxerxes, order all the treasurers across the river to quickly do whatever Ezra the priest, who knows God's law, asks of you.

22 To a hundred talents of silver, a hundred measures of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of oil, and as much salt as needed.

23 Do whatever the God of heaven has ordered, carefully and for the good of the God of heaven's temple. Why should anger come upon the king's kingdom and his children?

24 We also tell you that no taxes, payments, or fees should be put on the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or workers of God's house.

25 Ezra, use the wisdom of God you have to appoint officials and judges who can rule over the people across the river, all who know God's laws; and teach the laws to those who don't know them.

26 Anyone who does not follow God's law or the king's law should be punished quickly, whether by death, exile, taking their possessions, or putting them in jail.

27 May God, the God of our ancestors, be praised for inspiring the king to make the temple in Jerusalem beautiful.

28 God has shown me mercy in front of the king, his advisors, and all the powerful nobles. I felt strong because God was with me, and I brought together leaders from Israel to go with me.
