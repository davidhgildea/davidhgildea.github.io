1 After these events, someone informed Joseph, "Look, your father is ill," so he brought his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him.

2 Someone told Jacob, "Look, your son Joseph is coming to you," and Jacob gathered his strength and sat up in bed.

3 Jacob told Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in Canaan and blessed me."

4 He told me, 'Look, I will make you have many children and increase your numbers. I will turn you into a large group of people, and I will give this land to your descendants after you to own forever.'

5 Your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, born in Egypt before I arrived, are now mine just like Reuben and Simeon.

6 Your children born after them will belong to you and take their brothers' family name in the inheritance.

7 When I was returning from Padan, Rachel died near me in Canaan before we reached Ephrath, and I buried her on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.

8 Israel saw Joseph's sons and asked, "Who are they?"

9 Joseph told his father, "These are my sons, whom God has given to me here." Then he said, "Please bring them to me, so I can bless them."

10 Israel's eyes were weak from old age, and he could not see well. He brought them close, kissed them, and hugged them.

11 Israel said to Joseph, I never expected to see you again, but now, God has let me see your children too.

12 Joseph took them from between his knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.

13 Joseph took both Ephraim in his right hand to his father's left, and Manasseh in his left hand to his father's right, and brought them close to him.

14 Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim's head, the younger one, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, moving his hands purposely because Manasseh was the older.

15 He blessed Joseph and said, "God, who my ancestors Abraham and Isaac followed, the God who has taken care of me all my life until today,

16 The angel who saved me from all harm, bless the boys. Let them carry on my name and the names of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac, and let them become a large group on the earth.

17 When Joseph saw his father put his right hand on Ephraim's head, he was unhappy. He lifted his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.

18 Joseph said to his father, "No, my father, this one is the oldest; place your right hand on his head."

19 His father said no, and replied, I know, my son, I know. He too will become a group of people and be great. Yet his younger brother will be even greater, and his descendants will form many nations.

20 On that day, he gave them a blessing, saying, "Israel will use your name to give blessings, praying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh,'" and he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.

21 Israel said to Joseph, "Look, I am dying, but God will be with you and will take you back to your ancestors' land."

22 I have also given you an extra share beyond your brothers, which I took from the Amorite using my sword and bow.
