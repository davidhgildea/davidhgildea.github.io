1 Sarah lived to be 127 years old.

2 Sarah died in Kirjatharba, also called Hebron, in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn and cry for her.

3 Abraham got up from near his deceased and said to Heth's sons,

4 I am a foreigner and traveler among you. Please let me have a place to bury my dead, so I can bury them and not see them anymore.

5 The Heth people replied to Abraham, saying to him,

6 Listen to us, sir: you are a respected leader among us. Choose any of our burial places to bury your dead. No one here will refuse you their grave for you to bury your dead.

7 Abraham stood up and bowed to the local people, including the Heth family members.

8 He talked with them, saying, "If you agree that I should bury my dead away from me, listen to me and ask Ephron son of Zohar for help."

9 He should sell me the cave of Machpelah that he owns, located at the edge of his field. I will pay its full price so it can be my burial site among you.

10 Ephron lived with the Heth people and in front of them, and all who entered his city's gate, Ephron the Hittite replied to Abraham, saying,

11 No, my lord, listen to me: I give you the field and the cave in it; I give it to you in front of my people's sons; bury your dead.

12 Abraham bowed down to the local people.

13 He spoke to Ephron with the people of the land listening, saying, "But if you will give it, please listen to me: I will pay you money for the field. Accept it from me, so I can bury my dead there."

14 Ephron replied to Abraham, saying to him,

15 Sir, please listen to me: the land costs four hundred silver coins; what difference does that make between us? Go ahead and bury your dead.

16 Abraham listened to Ephron and paid him the 400 silver coins he had mentioned in front of the Heth's sons, which was the usual money used in trade.

17 Ephron's field in Machpelah, near Mamre, including the field, the cave in it, and all the trees around its edges, was secured.

18 To Abraham as his own land, seen by the Heth people, in front of everyone at his city gate.

19 After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave at Machpelah field near Mamre, which is Hebron in Canaan.

20 The field and the cave in it were guaranteed to Abraham as a burial place by the Heth sons.
