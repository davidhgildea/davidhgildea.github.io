1 During the time when Amraphel ruled Shinar, Arioch ruled Ellasar, Chedorlaomer ruled Elam, and Tidal ruled many nations;

2 These kings fought against Bera of Sodom, Birsha of Gomorrah, Shinab of Admah, Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

3 All these were united in the Siddim Valley, now the Salt Sea.

4 For twelve years they obeyed Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.

5 In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings with him defeated the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim.

6 The Horites lived in Seir mountain, reaching to Elparan near the desert.

7 They went back and came to Enmishpat, known as Kadesh, and defeated all the land of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazezontamar.

8 The kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (also called Zoar) went out and fought a battle with them in the Siddim Valley.

9 With Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, Tidal, the king of nations, Amraphel, the king of Shinar, and Arioch, the king of Ellasar; four kings joined together against five.

10 The Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits. The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah ran away, but they fell into the pits. Those who were left ran to the hills.

11 They took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, all their food, and left.

12 They captured Lot, Abram's nephew, who lived in Sodom, along with his possessions, and left.

13 Someone who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew, who was living near Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and Aner. These men were allies of Abram.

14 When Abram learned his brother was captured, he equipped his skilled servants, born in his home, 318 in number, and chased the captors to Dan.

15 He split his group and, with his servants, attacked at night, defeated them, and chased them to Hobah, north of Damascus.

16 He took back all the items, and also returned his brother Lot, his items, the women, and the people.

17 The king of Sodom went to meet him after he came back from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings with him, at the Valley of Shaveh, also called the king's valley.

18 Melchizedek, the king of Salem, brought out bread and wine; he was a priest of the most high God.

19 He blessed him and said, "May Abram be blessed by God Most High, owner of heaven and earth."

20 May God, the Most High, be blessed, for he has given your enemies over to you. And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people, and keep the goods for yourself."

22 Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have raised my hand to God, the highest God, the owner of heaven and earth."

23 I won't take anything from you, not even a thread or a shoestring, so you can't say you made Abram rich.

24 Keep only what the young men have eaten and the share for the men who joined meâ€”Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; they should get their share.
