1 At the start, God made the sky and the earth.

2 The earth had no shape and was empty; darkness covered the deep water. And God's Spirit was moving over the water.

3 God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.

4 God saw the light was good and separated the light from the darkness.

5 God named the light Day and the dark Night. The evening and morning made up the first day.

6 God said, "Let there be a space between the waters to separate water from water."

7 God created the sky and separated the water below the sky from the water above it: and it happened.

8 God named the sky Heaven. The evening came, then the morning, and that was the second day.

9 God said, "Let the water under the sky come together in one area, so the dry ground can show," and that happened.

10 God named the dry land Earth and the collected waters Seas, and God saw it was good.

11 And God said, let the earth grow grass, plants that make seeds, and trees that make fruit with seeds inside, each kind of plant and tree having its own type of seed, on the earth. And it happened.

12 The earth produced grass, plants with seeds of their own kind, and trees with fruit containing seeds, each according to its kind. God saw it was good.

13 The evening and the morning made the third day.

14 God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them serve as signs to mark seasons, days, and years."

15 Let them be lights in the sky to shine on the earth, and it happened.

16 God made two big lights; the bigger one to shine during the day, and the smaller one to shine at night. He also made the stars.

17 God placed them in the sky to shine light on the earth.

18 To control the day and night, and to separate light from darkness: and God saw it was good.

19 The evening and the morning made the fourth day.

20 God said, "Let the water be full of living things that move, and let birds fly above the earth across the sky."

21 God made big whales and all kinds of animals that move in the water, which the water produced in large numbers, and all kinds of birds with wings. And God saw that it was good.

22 God blessed them and said, "Have many children, grow in number, fill the sea with life, and let birds increase on the land."

23 The evening came and then the morning, and that was the fifth day.

24 God said, "Let the earth produce living creatures of each kind: livestock, crawling things, and wild animals of each kind." And that's what happened.

25 God created the wild animals, each according to its kind, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that crawl on the earth according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

26 God said, "Let's make humans to look like us and be like us. They will rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the earth, and every crawling animal on the earth."

27 God made humans to look like himself; he made them male and female.

28 God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children, fill the earth, and control it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and every creature that moves on the earth."

29 God said, "Look, I have given you every plant with seeds on the earth and all the trees with fruit with seeds. They will be your food."

30 God has given every plant for food to all animals on the earth, every bird in the sky, and everything that crawls on the ground with life in it. And that's what happened.

31 God saw everything He made and it was very good. The evening and morning were the sixth day.
