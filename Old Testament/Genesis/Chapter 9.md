1 God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Have many children, increase in number, and fill the earth."

2 Every land animal, bird in the sky, creature that moves on the ground, and fish in the sea will be afraid of you; they are all given into your control.

3 All living creatures that move shall be food for you; just as I have given you all plants.

4 Do not eat meat that still has its life in it, which is its blood.

5 I will certainly demand an accounting for human lifeblood; from every animal and from each person I will demand it, and I will require it from anyone who takes another person's life.

6 Anyone who takes a person's life must have their own life taken by others because God made humans in his own image.

7 You, be fruitful and increase in number; produce a lot on the earth and grow more.

8 God spoke to Noah and his sons, saying,

9 I will make my promise with you and your descendants after you.

10 And with every animal with you, the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals on earth with you; from all that came out of the ark, to every wild animal on earth.

11 I will make my promise with you, no living things will be wiped out by a flood again, and there will not be another flood to ruin the earth.

12 God said, "This is the sign of the promise I make between me and you and every living creature with you, for all time to come."

13 I put my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of an agreement between me and the earth.

14 When I bring a cloud over the earth, you will see the bow in the cloud.

15 I will remember my agreement with you and every living being; never again will the waters turn into a flood to destroy all life.

16 The rainbow will be in the sky, and when I see it, I will remember the forever promise between God and every living being of all kinds on the earth.

17 God told Noah, "This is the sign of the promise I made with all living things on earth."

18 Noah's sons who left the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham was Canaan's father.

19 Noah had three sons, and from them the whole world was populated.

20 Noah started to farm and planted a vineyard.

21 He drank the wine, got drunk, and lay uncovered inside his tent.

22 Ham, Canaan's father, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.

23 Shem and Japheth took a cloth, put it on their shoulders, walked backward, and covered their father's bare body. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father unclothed.

24 Noah woke up from drinking wine and realized what his youngest son had done to him.

25 He said, "Cursed is Canaan; he will be the lowest servant to his brothers."

26 He said, "God bless Shem; Canaan will be his servant."

27 God will make Japheth's land and people grow, and he will live with Shem's family; Canaan will serve him.

28 Noah lived for 350 years after the flood.

29 Noah lived for 950 years, then he died.
