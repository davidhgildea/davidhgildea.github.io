1 Abraham married another woman, and her name was Keturah.

2 She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah for him.

3 Jokshan had Sheba and Dedan as sons. Dedan's sons were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.

4 Midian's sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were Keturah's children.

5 Abraham gave everything he owned to Isaac.

6 Abraham gave presents to his other sons, whose mother was a concubine, and sent them away from his son Isaac to the east land while he was still alive.

7 Abraham lived 175 years.

8 Then Abraham passed away and died at an old age, as an old man who lived a long life, and he joined his ancestors.

9 Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the Machpelah cave, in Ephron the Hittite's field near Mamre.

10 Abraham bought the field from the Heth sons; there, Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried.

11 After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Lahairoi well.

12 Here are the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, born to Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, by Abraham:

13 These are the names of Ishmael's sons, listed by their names, in order of their birth: Ishmael's first son is Nebajoth, then Kedar, Adbeel, and Mibsam.

14 Mishma, Dumah, and Massa,

15 Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

16 These are Ishmael's sons, with their names, by their towns and fortresses; twelve leaders for their tribes.

17 Ishmael lived 137 years. Then he died and joined his ancestors.

18 They lived from Havilah to Shur, near Egypt on the way to Assyria; and he died with all his brothers around.

19 These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham was the father of Isaac.

20 Isaac was 40 when he married Rebekah, who was the daughter of Bethuel from Syria and the sister of Laban, also from Syria.

21 Isaac prayed to God for his wife because she could not have children, and God answered his prayer, so his wife Rebekah became pregnant.

22 The babies inside her were fighting, and she wondered, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to ask God for answers.

23 God said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two different groups of people will come from you; one group will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger."

24 When the time came for her to give birth, she had twins in her belly.

25 The first baby was born red and covered with hair like a coat, and they named him Esau.

26 After that, his brother came out, grabbing Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.

27 The boys grew up: Esau became a skilled hunter, loving the outdoors; Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the tents.

28 Isaac loved Esau because he ate Esau's wild game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.

29 Jacob cooked stew, and Esau returned from the field, feeling weak.

30 Esau said to Jacob, "Please give me some of that red stew because I am very tired." That is why he was also called Edom.

31 Jacob said, Sell me your birthright today.

32 Esau said, "Look, I'm about to die; what good is my birthright to me?"

33 Jacob said, "Promise me today"; so he promised to him, and he sold his right as the firstborn to Jacob.

34 Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; Esau ate, drank, got up, and left, showing he cared little for his birthright.
