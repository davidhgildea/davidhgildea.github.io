1 God said to Noah, "You and your family come into the ark because I have seen you are good in this time."

2 Take seven pairs of every clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every unclean animal, a male and its mate.

3 Take seven pairs of each kind of bird, both male and female, to save their species on the earth.

4 In seven days, I will make it rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe out every living thing I have created from the earth.

5 Noah did everything that God told him to do.

6 Noah was 600 years old when the great flood came upon the earth.

7 Noah, his sons, his wife, and their wives all went into the boat because of the floodwaters.

8 About clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything that crawls on the ground,

9 Two by two, males and females, went into the ark to Noah, just as God told Noah to do.

10 Seven days later, the floodwaters covered the earth.

11 When Noah was 600 years old, on the 17th day of the second month, all the deep springs burst open, and the rain poured from the sky.

12 It rained on the earth for forty days and nights.

13 On that exact day, Noah, his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Noah's wife, and his sons' three wives all went into the ark.

14 They, and all animals of their own kinds, all livestock of their kinds, all small creatures that crawl on the ground of their kinds, and all birds of their kinds, every type of bird.

15 They entered the ark with Noah, two by two, from every creature that has the breath of life.

16 Those who entered, male and female of every living thing, did so as God had ordered; and God closed the door behind them.

17 The flood lasted forty days on the earth; the waters grew and lifted the boat, raising it above the ground.

18 The waters rose high and covered the earth; the ark floated on the surface of the water.

19 The waters grew very high on the earth, and covered all the tall hills under the sky.

20 The water rose fifteen cubits high, and it covered the mountains.

21 All living creatures that moved on the earth died, including birds, livestock, wild animals, all small creatures that crawl on the ground, and every person.

22 Everyone with the breath of life in their nostrils, on dry land, died.

23 Every creature on earth diedâ€”people, livestock, wildlife, and birds. They were all wiped out; only Noah and those with him on the boat survived.

24 The water covered the earth for one hundred and fifty days.
