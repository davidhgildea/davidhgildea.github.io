1 Dinah, Leah's daughter whom she had with Jacob, went out to meet the local girls.

2 When Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite and ruler of the land, saw her, he grabbed her, slept with her, and dishonored her.

3 He felt a deep connection with Dinah, Jacob's daughter, loved her, and spoke gently to her.

4 Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl to be my wife."

5 Jacob found out someone had mistreated his daughter Dinah. His sons were out in the fields with the livestock, so Jacob stayed quiet until they returned.

6 Hamor, Shechem's father, went to talk to Jacob.

7 Jacob's sons returned from the fields when they heard the news. They felt deeply hurt and very angry because someone did something very foolish in Israel by sleeping with Jacob's daughter, which should never have happened.

8 Hamor spoke to them, saying, "My son Shechem deeply desires to marry your daughter. Please let her become his wife."

9 Marry with us, give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves.

10 You will live with us, and the land will be open to you; live in it, trade in it, and own property in it.

11 Shechem said to her father and brothers, "I hope you will favor me, and I will give whatever you ask of me."

12 Ask for any amount of money or gifts for a dowry, and I will pay what you ask; but let me marry the young woman.

13 Jacob's sons lied to Shechem and his father Hamor when they spoke because Shechem had disgraced their sister Dinah.

14 They told them, "We can't do this and let our sister marry a man who is not circumcised; that would be shameful for us."

15 We agree with this condition: if every man among you gets circumcised, like us.

16 We will let you marry our daughters, and we will marry your daughters, and we will live with you, and we will become one group of people.

17 But if you won't listen to us and agree to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and leave.

18 Hamor and his son Shechem liked what they heard.

19 The young man did not hesitate to do it because he liked Jacob's daughter, and he was more respectable than everyone in his family.

20 Hamor and his son Shechem went to the entrance of their city and talked with the men of their city, saying,

21 These men are friendly towards us; so let them live in the land and do business there; the land is big enough for them; we can marry their daughters, and they can marry ours.

22 The men will agree to live with us and become one people only if every male among us gets circumcised just like they are.

23 Won't their animals, belongings, and all their beasts become ours? Just agree with them, and they will live with us.

24 Everyone in the city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every man was circumcised just as they were.

25 On the third day, when they were in pain, Jacob's two sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took a sword, attacked the city with courage, and killed all the men.

26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah from Shechem's house, and left.

27 Jacob's sons attacked the dead men and looted the city because those men had dishonored their sister.

28 They took their sheep, oxen, donkeys, and everything in the city and fields.

29 They captured all their riches, children, and wives, and took everything in the house.

30 Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have caused me problems, making me look bad to the people here, the Canaanites and Perizzites. We are few in number; they will unite against me, attack, and wipe out me and my family."

31 They asked, "Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?"
