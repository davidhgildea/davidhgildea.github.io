1 After these events, God tested Abraham. He called, "Abraham," and Abraham answered, "Here I am."

2 He said, "Now take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. There, offer him as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you."

3 Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, took two of his helpers and his son Isaac, cut wood for the sacrifice, and set out for the place God had mentioned to him.

4 On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place from a distance.

5 Abraham told his servants, "Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there to worship, and then we'll come back to you."

6 Abraham put the wood for the offering on his son Isaac; he carried the fire and a knife, and they walked on together.

7 Isaac said to his father Abraham, "My father?" Abraham replied, "Yes, my son." Isaac asked, "We have the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the sacrifice?"

8 Abraham said, "My son, God will find a lamb for a sacrifice." So they both went on together.

9 They reached the place God had mentioned; Abraham made an altar there, arranged the wood, tied up his son Isaac, and put him on the altar on top of the wood.

10 Abraham reached out his hand, grabbed the knife to kill his son.

11 God's messenger called to him from the sky, saying, "Abraham, Abraham!" And he answered, "I'm here."

12 He said, "Don't hurt the boy or do anything to him, because now I see that you respect God. You didn't refuse to give me your only son."

13 Abraham looked up and saw a ram with its horns stuck in the bushes behind him. He took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.

14 Abraham named that place "The Lord Will Provide." People still say today, "On God's mountain, it will be provided."

15 The angel of God called to Abraham from heaven again.

16 God said, "I promise by myself that, since you have done this and have not kept back your only son from me:

17 I will surely bless you and increase your descendants like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore; your descendants will conquer their enemies' cities.

18 Through your descendants, all countries of the world will be blessed because you listened to me.

19 Abraham went back to his servants, and together they got up and traveled to Beersheba; and Abraham lived in Beersheba.

20 After these events, someone told Abraham, "Look, Milcah has also given birth to children for your brother Nahor."

21 Huz was his first child, Buz was his brother, and Kemuel was Aram's father.

22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

23 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah gave birth to these eight children for Nahor, Abraham's brother.

24 His companion Reumah also had children: Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.
