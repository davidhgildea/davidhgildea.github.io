1 Abraham traveled from there to the southern lands and lived between Kadesh and Shur, and stayed in Gerar.

2 Abraham said about his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." So Abimelech, the king of Gerar, sent for and took Sarah.

3 God came to Abimelech in a dream at night and said, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is already married."

4 Abimelech had not been with her, and he said, "God, will you also kill a righteous nation?"

5 Didn't he tell me, 'She is my sister'? And she also said, 'He is my brother.' I did this with a clear heart and clean hands.

6 God spoke to him in a dream, saying, "Yes, I know you did this with a pure heart. That's why I kept you from sinning against me and did not let you touch her."

7 Now, give the man back his wife, because he is a prophet. He will pray for you, and you will live. But if you don't return her, know that you will surely die, you and everyone who belongs to you.

8 So Abimelech got up early in the morning, called all his workers, and spoke about all these things to them; and the men were very scared.

9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked him, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you, that you have brought a great sin on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not have been done."

10 Abimelech asked Abraham, "What did you see that made you do this?"

11 And Abraham said, "I thought, 'This place does not respect God, and they will kill me to take my wife.'"

12 She really is my sister, my father's daughter but not my mother's, and she became my wife.

13 When God made me leave my father's home, I told her, "Please be kind to me, and wherever we go, say 'He is my brother.'"

14 Abimelech gave Abraham sheep, oxen, male servants, and female servants, and returned his wife Sarah to him.

15 Abimelech said, "Look, my land is in front of you: live wherever you like."

16 God said to Sarah, "Look, I have given your brother a thousand silver coins. He will protect you in the eyes of everyone with you and everyone else." This was her correction.

17 Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, so they could have children.

18 God had made it so no woman in Abimelech's house could have children because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
