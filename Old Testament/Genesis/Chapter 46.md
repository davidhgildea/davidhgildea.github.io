1 Israel traveled with everything he owned, went to Beersheba, and gave sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.

2 God spoke to Israel in a night vision, saying, "Jacob, Jacob." And he replied, "I'm here."

3 He said, "I am God, your father's God. Do not be afraid to go to Egypt, because I will make you into a great nation there."

4 I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again, and Joseph will close your eyes.

5 Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel's sons took Jacob their father, their children, and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had provided for him.

6 They took their animals and belongings, which they had acquired in Canaan, and went to Egypt, with Jacob and all his descendants.

7 He brought his sons, grandsons, daughters, granddaughters, and all his family with him to Egypt.

8 These are the names of Israel's children who went to Egypt: Jacob and his sons, Reuben, Jacob's oldest.

9 Reuben's sons were Hanoch, Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

10 Simeon's sons were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, whose mother was a Canaanite woman.

11 The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

12 Judah had sons; Er, Onan, Shelah, Pharez, and Zarah. But, Er and Onan died in Canaan. Pharez had sons, Hezron and Hamul.

13 Issachar's sons were Tola, Phuvah, Job, and Shimron.

14 Zebulun's sons were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.

15 Leah had six sons and a daughter named Dinah with Jacob in Padanaram. In total, Jacob had thirty-three children.

16 Gad's sons were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.

17 Asher's sons were Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, and Beriah, and their sister was Serah. Beriah's sons were Heber and Malchiel.

18 These are Zilpah's sons, given by Laban to his daughter Leah, and she had them with Jacobâ€”a total of sixteen people.

19 Rachel, Jacob's wife, had two sons: Joseph and Benjamin.

20 In Egypt, Joseph had two sons named Manasseh and Ephraim, born to him by Asenath, who was the daughter of Potipherah, the priest of On.

21 Benjamin's sons were Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.

22 Rachel had fourteen children with Jacob.

23 Dan's sons: Hushim.

24 Naphtali's sons were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.

25 These are Bilhah's sons, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she had them for Jacob: in total, there were seven people.

26 Everyone who went to Egypt with Jacob, except for the wives of his sons, totaled 66 people.

27 Joseph had two sons born to him in Egypt. In total, seventy people from Jacob's family came to Egypt.

28 He sent Judah ahead to Joseph to show the way to Goshen, and they arrived in Goshen.

29 Joseph prepared his chariot, went to meet his father Israel in Goshen, showed himself to him, hugged him tightly, and cried on his shoulder for a long time.

30 Israel said to Joseph, "Now I can die happily because I have seen you and you are still alive."

31 Joseph told his brothers and his father's family, "I will go and tell Pharaoh, 'My brothers and my father's family from Canaan have come to me.'"

32 The men are shepherds because their job has been to take care of animals; and they have brought their sheep, their cattle, and everything they own.

33 When the king of Egypt asks you what you do,

34 Tell them, "We have always worked with animals, from when we were young to now, just like our ancestors did. This is so you can live in Goshen, because Egyptians dislike all shepherds."
