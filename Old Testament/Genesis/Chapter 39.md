1 Joseph was taken to Egypt; Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.

2 God was with Joseph, and he succeeded in everything; he lived in his Egyptian master's house.

3 His master noticed that God was with him and that God made everything he did successful.

4 Joseph won his favor and worked for him. He put him in charge of his house and everything he owned was given to him to look after.

5 From the time he became the manager of the house and everything in it, God blessed the Egyptian's home because of Joseph; everything he owned, both in the home and in the fields, was blessed by God.

6 He trusted Joseph with everything he had and didn't worry about anything except the food he ate. Joseph was handsome and well-liked.

7 After some time, his master's wife noticed Joseph and said, "Sleep with me."

8 But he refused and told his master's wife, "Look, my master doesn't know what I have in the house, and he has entrusted everything he owns to me."

9 No one in this house is greater than me; he has kept nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How can I then do such a terrible wrong and sin against God?

10 As she talked to Joseph every day, he did not listen to her or agree to sleep with her or spend time with her.

11 Around that time, Joseph entered the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were inside.

12 She grabbed his clothes and said, "Sleep with me," but he left his clothes in her hand and ran away.

13 When she saw he had left his clothes with her and ran away,

14 She called to the men of her house and said to them, "Look, he has brought a Hebrew here to make fun of us. He came to me to sleep with me, but I screamed loudly."

15 When he heard me raise my voice and cry out, he left his clothes with me and ran away.

16 She kept his clothing with her until her husband came home.

17 She said to him, "The Hebrew servant you brought here came to make fun of me."

18 As I raised my voice and screamed, he left his clothes with me and ran away.

19 When his master heard what his wife said, "This is how your servant treated me," he became very angry.

20 Joseph's boss arrested him and put him in the jail where the king's prisoners were kept, and he stayed in the jail.

21 God was with Joseph, showed him kindness, and made the prison guard like him.

22 The prison guard put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners; whatever was done there, Joseph did it.

23 The prison guard did not worry about anything in his care; because God was with Joseph, and God made everything Joseph did successful.
