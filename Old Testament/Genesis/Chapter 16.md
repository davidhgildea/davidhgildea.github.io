1 Sarai, Abram's wife, had no children. She had a servant from Egypt named Hagar.

2 Sarai said to Abram, "Look, God has kept me from having children. Please sleep with my servant; maybe I can have children through her." And Abram listened to what Sarai said.

3 Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar, her Egyptian maid, after Abram lived ten years in Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

4 He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she realized she was pregnant, she looked down on her mistress.

5 Sarai said to Abram, "I'm blaming you for this: I let you be with my servant, but now she's pregnant, she looks down on me. Let God decide who's right, me or you."

6 But Abram told Sarai, "Look, your servant is under your control; do what you think is best." And when Sarai was harsh with her, she ran away.

7 God's messenger met her by a water spring in the desert, near the spring on the road to Shur.

8 He asked, "Hagar, Sarai's servant, where did you come from and where are you going?" She answered, "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai."

9 The angel of God told her, "Go back to your mistress and do as she says."

10 God's messenger said to her, I will greatly increase your descendants so much that they will be too many to count.

11 The angel of God told her, "Look, you are going to have a baby boy and you will name him Ishmael; because God has heard about your troubles."

12 He will be a wild person; he will fight against everyone, and everyone will fight against him; he will live near all his family members.

13 She named God who spoke to her, "You are the God who sees me," because she thought, "I have seen the One who sees me."

14 So they named the well "The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me." It is located between Kadesh and Bered.

15 Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named the son she had, Ishmael.

16 Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael for Abram.
