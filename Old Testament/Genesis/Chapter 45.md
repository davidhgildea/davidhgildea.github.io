1 Joseph could not hold back in front of everyone present; he shouted, "Everyone leave me!" No one stayed with him when Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers.

2 He cried loudly, and the Egyptians and Pharaoh's household heard it.

3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Is our father still alive?" But his brothers couldn't answer him because they were upset to see him.

4 Joseph told his brothers, "Please come closer to me." They came closer. Then he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt."

5 So now, don't be sad or mad at yourselves for selling me here; because God sent me ahead of you to save lives.

6 For two years now, there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years, there will be no plowing or harvesting.

7 God sent me ahead of you to keep your family alive on the earth, and to save your lives with a big rescue.

8 It was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh, the boss of his household, and the leader of all Egypt.

9 Hurry and go to my father, and tell him, 'Your son Joseph says, God has made me ruler over all of Egypt: come to me, don't delay.'

10 You will live in the land of Goshen, close to me, with your children, grandchildren, sheep, cattle, and all your possessions.

11 I will provide for you there, because five more years of famine are coming, so that you, your family, and all you have won't become poor.

12 Look, your eyes and my brother Benjamin's eyes can see that it is really me talking to you.

13 Tell my father about all my success in Egypt and everything you've seen; hurry and bring my father here.

14 He hugged his brother Benjamin and cried; and Benjamin cried on his shoulder.

15 He kissed all his brothers and cried on them; then his brothers spoke with him.

16 People in Pharaoh's palace heard that Joseph's brothers had come, and this news made Pharaoh and his servants very happy.

17 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers to do this: Load your animals and go to the land of Canaan."

18 Bring your father and your families to me, and I will give you the best parts of Egypt, and you will have plenty to eat.

19 God has ordered you to do this: Get carts from Egypt for your children and wives, and bring your father here.

20 Don't worry about your belongings; all the best of Egypt is yours.

21 The Israelites did as told, and Joseph gave them carts as Pharaoh ordered, and also gave them food for the journey.

22 He gave clothes to all of them, but he gave Benjamin three hundred silver coins and five sets of clothes.

23 He sent his father the following: ten donkeys carrying Egypt's best goods, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and food for his journey.

24 He sent his brothers off, and they left. He told them, "Make sure you don't argue on the way."

25 They left Egypt and arrived in Canaan to meet their father Jacob.

26 They told him, "Joseph is still alive and he rules over all of Egypt." But Jacob felt weak because he did not believe them.

27 They told him everything Joseph said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph sent to bring him, Jacob their father felt better.

28 Israel said, "It is enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
