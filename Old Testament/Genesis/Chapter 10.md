1 Here are the family lines of Noah's sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. These sons had their own children after the flood.

2 Japheth's sons were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.

3 Gomer's sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.

4 Javan's sons were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

5 These people spread out over the islands and lands of non-Jewish peoples; each group by its language and family, in their own countries.

6 Ham's sons were Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan.

7 Cush had several sons: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah. Raamah had two sons: Sheba and Dedan.

8 Cush had a son named Nimrod, who became a powerful leader on Earth.

9 He was a strong hunter before God; that's why people say, "Like Nimrod, a strong hunter before God."

10 His kingdom started with Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh in Shinar's land.

11 From that country, Asshur left and built Nineveh, the city Rehoboth, and Calah.

12 Resen is between Nineveh and Calah; it is a great city.

13 Mizraim had sons named Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, and Naphtuhim.

14 And the people of Pathrus, Casluh, (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtor.

15 Canaan had Sidon, his oldest son, and Heth.

16 And the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

17 The Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite,

18 The Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites were there too. Later, the Canaanite families spread out.

19 The Canaanites' land started at Sidon, went to Gerar and then to Gaza; from there it reached all the way to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Lasha.

20 These are Ham's sons, grouped by their families, languages, lands, and nations.

21 Shem, the ancestor of all Eber's descendants and Japheth's older brother, also had children.

22 Shem's children were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.

23 Aram's children were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.

24 Arphaxad had a son named Salah, and Salah had a son named Eber.

25 Eber had two sons. One was named Peleg, because the earth was divided during his life. His brother was named Joktan.

26 Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, and Jerah.

27 Hadoram, Uzal, and Diklah

28 And Obal, Abimael, and Sheba,

29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab were all Joktan's sons.

30 Their home was from Mesha to Sephar, a mountain in the east.

31 These are Shem's sons, by their families, languages, in their countries, and by their nations.

32 These are the families of Noah's sons, grouped by their descendants, within their countries. And from these families the nations were spread out over the earth after the flood.
