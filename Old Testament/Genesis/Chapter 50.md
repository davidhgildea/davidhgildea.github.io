1 Joseph laid his face on his father's face, cried over him, and kissed him.

2 Joseph told his doctors to prepare his father's body, and the doctors did so for Israel.

3 He was prepared for forty days, as is the custom for the embalmed, and the Egyptians grieved for him seventy days.

4 After his mourning time ended, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh's officials and said, "If you think well of me, please tell Pharaoh."

5 My father asked me to promise, saying, "Look, I am dying; bury me in the grave I made for myself in Canaan." So please let me go and bury my father, and then I will come back.

6 Pharaoh said, "Go and bury your father, just as he made you promise."

7 Joseph went to bury his father, and all of Pharaoh's servants, the leaders of his household, and the elders of Egypt went with him.

8 Everyone from Joseph's family, his brothers, and their father's family went, but they left their young children, sheep, and cattle in Goshen.

9 Chariots and horsemen went with him, forming a large group.

10 They reached Atad's threshing floor, across the Jordan River, where they grieved deeply with loud crying; and he mourned his father for seven days.

11 When the local people, the Canaanites, saw the sadness at Atad's threshing floor, they said, "This is deep sorrow for the Egyptians." That's why they named the place Abelmizraim, which is across the Jordan.

12 His sons did as he told them to.

13 His sons took him to Canaan and buried him in Machpelah cave, in the field that Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre.

14 Joseph went back to Egypt with his brothers and everyone who joined him to bury his father, after they buried his father.

15 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father had died, they said, "Joseph might hate us and will surely pay us back for all the bad things we did to him."

16 They sent someone to tell Joseph, "Before your father died, he told us to say,

17 Tell Joseph, please forgive your brothers' wrongdoing and sin, because they hurt you. And now, please forgive the wrong that God your father's servants have done. Joseph cried when they talked to him.

18 His brothers also went and bowed down in front of him, saying, "Look, we are your servants."

19 Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in God's place?"

20 You planned to do me harm, but God turned it into good, to achieve what we see today: to save many lives.

21 So do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your children. He reassured them and spoke gently to them.

22 Joseph lived in Egypt with his family and he lived to be 110 years old.

23 Joseph saw his great-grandchildren through Ephraim, and Machir's children, Manasseh's descendants, were raised on Joseph's lap.

24 Joseph told his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will come to you and take you from this land to the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."

25 Joseph made the children of Israel promise, saying, "God will definitely come to you, and you must take my bones from here."

26 Joseph died at the age of 110, and they preserved his body. He was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
