1 Everyone on earth spoke the same language.

2 As they traveled from the east, they found a flat area in the land of Shinar and they settled there.

3 They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them well." They used bricks instead of stones and tar for mortar.

4 They said, "Come on, let's build a city and a tower that reaches to the sky, so we can make a name for ourselves and not be spread out over the whole world."

5 God came down to see the city and the tower that people were building.

6 God said, "Look, the people are united, and they all speak the same language; this is what they have started to do: now they can do anything they think of."

7 Let's go down and mix up their language, so they can't understand each other.

8 So God spread them out from there all over the earth, and they stopped building the city.

9 So they named it Babel, because there God mixed up everyone's language and scattered them all over the world.

10 These are Shem's family records: Shem was 100 years old and fathered Arphaxad two years after the flood.

11 After Shem became the father of Arphaxad, he lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.

12 Arphaxad was 35 years old when he became the father of Salah.

13 After Arphaxad became the father of Salah, he lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.

14 Salah was thirty years old when he became the father of Eber.

15 Salah lived for 403 years after Eber's birth and had more sons and daughters.

16 Eber lived 34 years and then became the father of Peleg.

17 Eber lived for 430 years after the birth of Peleg and had more sons and daughters.

18 Peleg was thirty years old when he became the father of Reu.

19 Peleg lived for 209 years after Reu was born, and he had more sons and daughters.

20 Reu was thirty-two when he became the father of Serug.

21 Reu lived for 207 years after Serug was born, and he had more sons and daughters.

22 Serug was thirty years old when he had Nahor.

23 Serug lived for 200 years after Nahor was born and had more sons and daughters.

24 Nahor lived 29 years and had a son named Terah.

25 After Nahor had his son Terah, he lived 119 more years and had more sons and daughters.

26 Terah lived for 70 years and had three sons: Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

27 Here are the descendants of Terah: Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.

28 Haran died before his father Terah in his birthplace, in Ur of the Chaldees.

29 Abram and Nahor married. Abram's wife was Sarai, and Nahor's wife was Milcah, Haran's daughter, who was also Iscah's father.

30 Sarai could not have children; she had none.

31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, Abram's wife; and they left Ur of the Chaldees to go to Canaan. But they stopped at Haran and lived there.

32 Terah lived for 205 years and then he died in Haran.
