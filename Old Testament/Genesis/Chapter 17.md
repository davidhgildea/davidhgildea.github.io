1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, God came to Abram and said, "I am Almighty God; walk with me and be blameless."

2 I will create an agreement between us, and I will greatly increase your numbers.

3 Abram lay face down, and God spoke to him.

4 I promise to support you, and you will become the father of many nations.

5 Your name will no longer be Abram, but Abraham, because I have made you a father of many nations.

6 I will make you very fruitful, and you will become nations, and kings will come from you.

7 I will make my promise between me and you and your descendants after you, for all time to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.

8 I will give you and your descendants the land where you are now just a traveler, all the land of Canaan, to own forever; and I will be their God.

9 God told Abraham, "You must keep my agreement, you and your descendants for generations to come."

10 This is my agreement, which you must follow, between me and you and your children after you; Every male among you must be circumcised.

11 You must cut off the skin of your foreskin as a sign of the agreement between me and you.

12 Every baby boy who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your family or bought with money from a foreignerâ€”even if they are not your biological children.

13 Anyone born in your house or bought with your money must be circumcised, and this will be a lasting agreement shown in your body.

14 If a boy is not circumcised, he will be separated from his people because he has broken my agreement.

15 God said to Abraham, "Don't call your wife Sarai anymore. Her name is now Sarah."

16 I will bless her and also give you a son by her. I will truly bless her, and she will become the mother of many nations; kings from many people will come from her.

17 Abraham fell to the ground, laughed, and thought to himself, "Will a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?"

18 Abraham said to God, "I wish that Ishmael may live under your care!"

19 God said, "Your wife Sarah will truly have a son for you; and you will name him Isaac. I will make my promise with him as a forever promise, and with his descendants after him."

20 As for Ishmael, I have listened to you. I have blessed him and will make him very fruitful. He will have many descendants and create twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.

21 I will make my agreement with Isaac, whom Sarah will give birth to for you at this time next year.

22 He stopped talking to him, and God left Abraham and went away.

23 Abraham took his son Ishmael, everyone born in his house, and all the males bought with his money, and on that very day, he circumcised them as God had told him to do.

24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised.

25 Ishmael was thirteen when he got circumcised.

26 On that same day, Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.

27 All the men of his household, those born in his house and those bought with money from foreigners, were circumcised with him.
