1 Zelophehad's daughters came to Moses. Zelophehad was Hepherâ€™s son, Gilead's son, Machir's son, and Manasseh's son from Joseph's family. His daughters were named Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

2 They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the whole community at the entrance of the meeting tent, saying,

3 Our father died alone in the desert, not with those who turned against God with Korah; he died because of his own sin and had no sons.

4 Why should our father's name disappear from his family because he has no son? Give us property among our father's brothers.

5 Moses took their case to God.

6 God spoke to Moses, saying,

7 Zelophehad's daughters are correct: you must give them property to inherit among their father's brothers, and you must give them their father's inheritance.

8 Tell the people of Israel, if a man dies and has no son, then you must give his property to his daughter.

9 If he has no daughter, then you must give his inheritance to his brothers.

10 If he has no brothers, then you should give his inheritance to his uncles.

11 If his father has no brothers, give his property to the closest relative in his family, and they will own it. This will be a permanent law for the people of Israel, as God told Moses.

12 God told Moses, "Go up this mountain Abarim and look at the land I have given to the people of Israel."

13 When you have seen it, you too will die as your brother Aaron did.

14 You disobeyed my order in the Zin desert, during the people's argument, to show my holiness at the water in front of them: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the Zin desert.

15 Moses spoke to God, saying,

16 Let God, the God of everyone's spirit, choose someone to lead the group.

17 Who can lead them and bring them back, so God's people won't be like sheep without a shepherd.

18 God told Moses, "Take Joshua, son of Nun, a man with the spirit, and put your hand on him."

19 Place him in front of Priest Eleazar and all the people; and give him instructions while they watch.

20 Give him some of your honor so that all the Israelite community will follow his lead.

21 He will stand in front of priest Eleazar, who will seek advice for him by consulting the Urim before God. They will follow his commands to leave and to return, he and all the Israelites with him, as well as the whole community.

22 Moses did what God told him: he took Joshua, put him in front of priest Eleazar, and in front of everyone gathered.

23 He put his hands on him and gave him instructions, just as God had ordered through Moses.
