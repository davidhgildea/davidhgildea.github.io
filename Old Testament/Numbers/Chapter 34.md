1 And God spoke to Moses, saying,

2 Tell the Israelites, when you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that will be your inheritance, the land of Canaan and its borders.

3 Your southern area will start from the Zin wilderness, going by Edom's edge, and your southern boundary will be the farthest shore of the Salt Sea to the east.

4 Your boundary will go from the south up to the Akrabbim Scarp, continue to Zin, and start out from the south to Kadesh Barnea. Then it will move on to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon.

5 The border will go around from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and it will end at the sea.

6 Your western border will be the big sea: this is your western edge.

7 Your northern boundary will start from the Great Sea and go to Mount Hor.

8 From Mount Hor, you will mark your boundary to the entrance of Hamath; and the end of the boundary will be at Zedad.

9 The border will continue to Ziphron, and it will end at Hazarenan: this will be your northern boundary.

10 Mark your eastern border from Hazarenan to Shepham.

11 The border will extend from Shepham to Riblah, east of Ain; it will go down and stretch to the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.

12 The boundary will go down to the Jordan River, and end at the Salt Sea. This will be your land, including all its borders.

13 Moses told the Israelites, "This is the land that you will receive as your inheritance, which God has instructed to be given to the nine and a half tribes."

14 The Reuben family tribe and the Gad family tribe have gotten their land, and half of the Manasseh family tribe has gotten theirs too.

15 The two and a half tribes got their land east of the Jordan River by Jericho, toward the sunrise.

16 God spoke to Moses, saying,

17 Here are the names of the men who will divide the land for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua, Nun's son.

18 You will choose one leader from each tribe to divide the land as an inheritance.

19 The men's names are as follows: From Judah's tribe, Caleb son of Jephunneh.

20 From the Simeon tribe, Shemuel, Ammihud's son.

21 From the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad, Chislon's son.

22 The leader from the tribe of Dan's descendants was Bukki, Jogli's son.

23 The leader of Joseph's descendants from the Manasseh tribe was Hanniel, Ephod's son.

24 The leader of the Ephraim tribe, Kemuel son of Shiphtan.

25 The leader from the Zebulun people's group, Elizaphan, Parnach's son.

26 The leader from Issachar's tribe was Paltiel, Azzan's son.

27 The leader from the Asher tribe, Ahihud, Shelomi's son.

28 The leader from Naphtali's tribe, the son of Ammihud, was Pedahel.

29 These are the people God told to divide the land for the Israelites to inherit in Canaan.
