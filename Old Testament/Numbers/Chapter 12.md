1 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because he married a woman from Ethiopia.

2 They asked, "Has God spoken only through Moses? Hasn't he also spoken through us?" And God heard this.

3 Moses was the humblest man on earth, more than anyone else.

4 God spoke suddenly to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, saying, "You three come to the meeting tent." And the three of them went out.

5 God came down in the cloud pillar, stood at the tabernacle entrance, and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came out.

6 He said, "Listen to me: If there's a prophet with you, God will reveal himself in a vision and speak to him in a dream."

7 My servant Moses is different; he is trustworthy in all my household.

8 I will talk directly and clearly with him, not in riddles, and he will see a form of God. So why weren't you afraid to speak against my servant Moses?

9 God became angry with them, and he left.

10 The cloud moved away from the tent, and Miriam had a skin disease, white like snow. Aaron saw Miriam and she had the skin disease.

11 Aaron said to Moses, "Sorry, my lord, I ask you, don't blame us for the foolish things we have done and for our sins."

12 Do not let her be like a newborn that is half dead with rotting flesh.

13 Moses called out to God, saying, "Please God, heal her now."

14 God told Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, wouldn't she feel shame for seven days? Keep her out of the camp for seven days, and after that, she can come back."

15 Miriam had to stay outside the camp for seven days; the people did not move on until Miriam was allowed back in.

16 Later, the people left Hazeroth and set up camp in the Paran wilderness.
