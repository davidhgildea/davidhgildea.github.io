1 These are the travels of the Israelites who left Egypt with their soldiers led by Moses and Aaron.

2 Moses recorded where they traveled from as God instructed; these are their travels based on where they left.

3 They left Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day; the day after Passover, the Israelites left boldly while all the Egyptians watched.

4 The Egyptians buried all their firstborn whom God had struck down. God also punished their gods.

5 The Israelites left Rameses and camped in Succoth.

6 They left Succoth and set up camp in Etham, at the border of the wilderness.

7 They left Etham, turned back to Pihahiroth near Baalzephon, and camped in front of Migdol.

8 They left Pihahiroth, went through the sea to the desert, traveled for three days in the Etham desert, and camped at Marah.

9 They left Marah and arrived at Elim, where there were twelve water springs and seventy palm trees; they set up camp there.

10 They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.

11 They left the Red Sea and camped in the Sin Desert.

12 They traveled from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah.

13 They left Dophkah and camped at Alush.

14 They moved from Alush and camped at Rephidim where there was no water for the people to drink.

15 They left Rephidim and camped in the Sinai desert.

16 They left the Sinai Desert and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.

17 They left Kibrothhattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.

18 They left Hazeroth and set up camp in Rithmah.

19 They left Rithmah and set up camp at Rimmonparez.

20 They left Rimmonparez and camped at Libnah.

21 They moved from Libnah and camped at Rissah.

22 They traveled from Rissah and camped in Kehelathah.

23 They left Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shapher.

24 They moved from Mount Shapher and camped in Haradah.

25 They moved from Haradah and set up camp in Makheloth.

26 They moved from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.

27 They left Tahath and set up camp at Tarah.

28 They moved from Tarah and set up camp in Mithcah.

29 They left Mithcah and set up camp in Hashmonah.

30 They left Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.

31 They left Moseroth and camped at Benejaakan.

32 They moved from Benejaakan and camped at Horhagidgad.

33 They traveled from Horhagidgad and camped at Jotbathah.

34 They moved from Jotbathah and set up camp at Ebronah.

35 They left Ebronah and camped at Eziongaber.

36 They moved from Eziongaber and camped in the Zin Desert, near Kadesh.

37 They moved from Kadesh and set up camp on Mount Hor, at the border of Edom.

38 Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor because God told him to, and he died there. It was forty years after the people of Israel left Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month.

39 Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.

40 The Canaanite King Arad, who lived in the southern part of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming.

41 They left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.

42 They left Zalmonah and set up camp in Punon.

43 They left Punon and camped at Oboth.

44 They left Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, on the edge of Moab.

45 They left Iim and set up camp in Dibongad.

46 They moved from Dibongad and camped at Almondiblathaim.

47 They moved from Almondiblathaim and camped in the Abarim mountains, near Nebo.

48 They left the Abarim mountains and camped in the Moab plains by the Jordan near Jericho.

49 They camped by the Jordan River, from Bethjesimoth to Abelshittim in the Moab plains.

50 God spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan River near Jericho, saying,

51 Tell the people of Israel, when you cross the Jordan River into the land of Canaan.

52 Then you must force all the people of the land to leave, destroy all their images, melt down all their idols, and tear down all their worship places.

53 You will take over the land and live in it because I have given it to you to own.

54 You will divide the land by drawing lots to decide which family gets which part: give bigger parts to larger families and smaller parts to smaller families. Each person's land will be where their lot lands, and you will inherit land based on your ancestral tribes.

55 If you do not force the people of the land to leave, the ones you allow to stay will cause you trouble, hurt your eyes, and bother you where you live.

56 I will do to you what I planned to do to them.
