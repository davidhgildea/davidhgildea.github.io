1 God spoke to Moses in the Sinai wilderness, in the meeting tent, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after leaving Egypt, saying,

2 Count all the members of Israel's community by family groups, according to their fathers' houses, and list the names of all the men one by one.

3 Count everyone in Israel aged 20 and older who can fight in the army, you and Aaron must organize them by their military groups.

4 You will have one man from each tribe with you; each one will be the leader of his family.

5 Here are the names of the men who will be with you: from Reuben's tribe, Elizur son of Shedeur.

16 These were famous leaders of the group, chiefs of their family tribes, and in charge of thousands in Israel.

17 Moses and Aaron took these men whose names were listed.

18 They gathered the whole community on the first day of the second month. They listed their family lines by their fathers' houses, by name, starting from age twenty and above, counting each man.

19 As God told Moses, so he counted them in the Sinai wilderness.

20 The descendants of Reuben, Israel's oldest son, were organized by their generations, families, and fathers' houses. The list included every man 20 years old and older who could fight in the war.

21 The tribe of Reuben had 46,500 people counted.

22 From Simeon's descendants, by their generations and family groups, according to their fathers' houses, the men counted by name, each one over twenty years old and able to fight in war, were listed.

23 The tribe of Simeon had 59,300 people counted.

24 From the descendants of Gad, grouped by their generations and family lines, and according to their fathers' households, everyone 20 years old and older who could fight in war was counted.

25 The total number of the tribe of Gad was 45,650.

26 From the tribe of Judah, organized by their family lines and ancestors' houses, counting each person by name, all the men aged twenty and above who could fight in the war.

27 The census counted 74,600 people from the tribe of Judah.

28 From the tribe of Issachar came men who were listed by their family lines and fathers' houses. Anyone 20 years old or older who could fight in the army was included by name.

29 The tribe of Issachar had 54,400 people counted.

30 From the tribe of Zebulun, listed by generations and families, from each father's house, everyone aged twenty or older who could go to war.

31 The tribe of Zebulun had 57,400 people counted.

32 From Joseph's descendants, specifically from Ephraim's line, they were counted by generations, family groups, and fathers' houses, including everyone 20 years and older who could fight in wars.

33 The count of people from the tribe of Ephraim was forty thousand and five hundred.

34 From the descendants of Manasseh, according to their family lines and their fathers' houses, following the list of names and counting those twenty years old and above, all those fit for military service.

35 The tribe of Manasseh had 32,200 people counted.

36 From Benjamin's descendants, by their family lines, according to their fathers' houses, counting each name from age twenty and older, all who could go to war.

37 The tribe of Benjamin had 35,400 people counted.

44 These are the people counted by Moses, Aaron, and the twelve leaders of Israel, with one man representing each family.

45 All the Israelites counted by their families, from age twenty and up, who could fight in war, were included.

46 All those counted were 603,550.

47 The Levites from their ancestors' tribe were not counted with them.

48 God had spoken to Moses, saying,

49 Do not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the Israelites.

50 You should put the Levites in charge of the tent of testimony, all its equipment, and everything that belongs to it. They will carry the tent and all its equipment; they will take care of it and camp around the tent.

51 When it's time to move the tent, the Levites will take it apart, and when it's time to set up the tent, the Levites will put it together. Anyone else who comes close will be killed.

52 The Israelites will set up their tents, each person near their own group, and each person by their own flag, among their units.

53 The Levites must camp around the tent of the covenant so that God's anger does not fall on the Israelites, and the Levites are responsible for looking after the tent of the covenant.

54 The Israelites did everything God told Moses to do.
