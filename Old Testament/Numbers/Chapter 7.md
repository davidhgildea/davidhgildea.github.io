1 On the day Moses finished setting up the tent of meeting, he put oil on it, made it holy, and did the same for all its equipment, the altar, and all its tools.

2 The leaders of Israel, the heads of their families, who were in charge of the tribes and oversaw the counting, gave offerings.

3 They presented their gift to God: six covered carts and twelve oxen. Each two leaders shared a cart, and each leader had an ox. They brought them in front of the tent of meeting.

4 God spoke to Moses, saying,

5 Accept it from them so they can work in the meeting tent; give it to the Levites, to each one as his work requires.

6 Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.

7 He gave the sons of Gershon two carts and four oxen, as needed for their work.

8 God gave the sons of Merari four wagons and eight oxen because of their work, with Ithamar, Aaron's son and priest, in charge.

9 But he did not give any to the Kohathites, because their task was to carry the holy things on their shoulders.

10 The leaders gave gifts to honor the altar on the day it was blessed, and they presented their gifts in front of the altar.

11 God told Moses, "Each leader should give their gift on their own day to dedicate the altar."
