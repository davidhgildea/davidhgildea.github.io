1 God spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

2 Each man from Israel's tribes will camp under his own flag, near the banner of his family: they will set up their tents around the tent where the people meet.

3 On the east side, where the sun comes up, the tribe of Judah will set up camp under their flag with their army: Nahshon son of Amminadab will lead them.

4 His army and the counted number of them were seventy-four thousand six hundred.

5 The group camping next to them will be the Issachar tribe, with Nethaneel son of Zuar as the leader of the Issachar people.

6 His army and the counted men totaled fifty-four thousand four hundred.

7 Next, the group from Zebulun: Eliab son of Helon will lead the Zebulun people.

8 His army, and the counted people in it, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.

9 In Judah's camp, 186,400 soldiers were counted. They will march first.

10 On the south side, the flag of Reuben's camp will be set up for their military units: and Elizur son of Shedeur will lead Reuben's people.

11 His army, with everyone counted, was 46,500.

12 The group camping next to him will be the Simeon tribe, and their leader will be Shelumiel, Zurishaddai's son.

13 His army, and the counted people in it, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.

14 The group from Gad: Eliasaph, Reuel's son, will lead Gad's descendants.

15 His army, and the counted ones, were forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.

16 In Reuben's camp, 151,450 people were counted, organized in their groups. They will march second.

17 Then the tent where people meet will move with the Levites' camp in the middle of all the camps. As they camp, they will move, each person in their own spot under their flags.

18 The west side will have Ephraim's camp flag, with their soldiers, and Elishama son of Ammihud will lead Ephraim's people.

19 His army and the counted men were forty-five thousand five hundred.

20 The Manasseh tribe will be with him, and their leader will be Gamaliel, Pedahzur's son.

21 His army, and the counted number in it, were thirty-two thousand and two hundred.

22 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the leader of Benjamin's people will be Abidan, Gideoni's son.

23 His army, and the counted number of them, was thirty-five thousand four hundred.

24 The army of Ephraim had 108,100 soldiers. They will march third.

25 The flag of Dan's camp will be on the north side by their troops, and the leader of Dan's people will be Ahiezer, Ammishaddai's son.

26 His army and the counted number of them were 62,700.

27 The group camping next to him will be the Asher tribe, and the Asher tribe leader will be Pagiel, Ocran's son.

28 His army, and the counted men, were forty-one thousand five hundred.

29 The Naphtali tribe: Ahira, son of Enan, will be the leader of Naphtali's people.

30 His army, with those counted, was fifty-three thousand four hundred.

31 In Dan's camp, there were 157,600 people counted. They will march last under their banners.

32 These are the numbers of the Israelites counted by their family groups: all of those counted in the camps throughout their groups totaled 603,550.

33 The Levites were not counted with the Israelites, as God told Moses.

34 The Israelites did everything God told Moses: they camped under their flags and moved out grouped by family, following their ancestors' houses.
