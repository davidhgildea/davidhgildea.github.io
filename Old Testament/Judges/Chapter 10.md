1 After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah, Dodo's son from the tribe of Issachar, became a leader to protect Israel. He lived in Shamir in the Ephraim hills.

2 He ruled Israel for twenty-three years, then he died and was buried in Shamir.

3 After him, Jair from Gilead became a leader and judged Israel for twenty-two years.

4 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty young donkeys, and they owned thirty cities called Havothjair, which exist to this day in Gilead.

5 Jair died and was buried in Camon.

6 The Israelites did bad things again before God, worshipped Baal and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, Zidon, Moab, Ammon's children, and the Philistines, and left God and did not worship Him.

7 God became very angry with Israel and handed them over to the Philistines and to the Ammonites.

8 That year they troubled and mistreated the Israelites for eighteen years. This happened to all the Israelites living across the Jordan River in the land of the Amorites in Gilead.

9 The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to also fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the Ephraimites, causing great trouble for Israel.

10 The people of Israel called out to God, saying, "We have sinned against you, for we have left our God and also worshiped Baalim."

11 God asked the Israelites, "Didn't I save you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, and the Philistines?"

12 The people of Sidon, the Amalekites, and the Maonites also troubled you. When you called out to me, I saved you from them.

13 You have left me and served other gods, so I will not save you anymore.

14 Go and call out to the gods you picked; let them save you when you are in trouble.

15 The children of Israel told God, "We have sinned. Do to us whatever you think is best, but please, save us today."

16 They removed the foreign gods from among them and worshiped God; and he felt sorry for Israel's suffering.

17 The people of Ammon came together and set up camp in Gilead. The people of Israel also gathered and set up camp in Mizpeh.

18 The people and leaders of Gilead asked each other, "Who will start the fight against the Ammonites? He will become the leader of everyone in Gilead."
