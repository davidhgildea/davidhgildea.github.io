</figure>
1 A person born from a woman lives only a short time and has many problems.

2 He blooms like a flower and then is trimmed. He also flees like a shadow and does not stay.

3 Do you watch such a person and bring me to trial with you?

4 Who can make a clean thing from an unclean one? No one.

5 God has set the number of his days, and knows how many months he will live. You have decided his limits, which he cannot go beyond.

6 Let him alone so he can have peace until he finishes his workday like a worker.

7 A tree has hope because if it's cut down, it can grow back, and its new shoots won't stop.

8 Even if its roots grow old in the earth and its stump dies in the ground;

9 Even if it smells water, it will sprout and grow branches like a plant.

10 When a person dies, they decay; when they stop breathing, where do they go?

11 As the water disappears from the sea, and a riverbed becomes dry and empty:

12 People lie down and do not rise again; until the sky is gone, they will not wake up or be woken from their sleep.

13 I wish you would hide me in the grave and keep me hidden until your anger is over, then set a time to remember me.

14 If someone dies, will they live again? I will wait for all the days set for me until it is my turn to change.

15 You will call, and I will answer you; you will long for what your hands have made.

16 You count my steps now; are you not keeping watch on my sin?

17 My wrong is locked in a bag, and you stitch up my sin.

18 Mountains crumble and disappear, and rocks are moved from their spots.

19 Water wears down stones; you wash away the soil's growth; you crush human hopes.

20 You always win against him, and he goes away; you change his face, and send him off.

21 His sons achieve honor but he doesn't know it; they are humbled, yet he doesn't notice.

22 His body will feel pain, and his heart will be sad.
