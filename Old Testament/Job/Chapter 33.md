1 So Job, please listen to what I say and pay attention to all my words.

2 Look, now I have opened my mouth and my tongue has spoken inside it.

3 I will speak what is true and my words will clearly show what I know.

4 God's spirit made me, and the Almighty's breath gave me life.

5 If you can answer me, arrange your words clearly and stand up.

6 Look, I am just as you want, in place of God: I am made from clay too.

7 You don't need to fear my terror, nor will my hand be hard on you.

8 You have definitely spoken where I could hear, and I have heard what you said.

9 I am clean and have not wronged anyone, I am innocent; I have done nothing wrong.

10 Look, He finds reasons to accuse me; He considers me His enemy.

11 He puts my feet in shackles and watches all the ways I walk.

12 Look, you are not right in this: I will tell you that God is greater than a human.

13 Why do you argue with God? He doesn't need to explain anything he does.

14 God speaks once, even twice, but people do not notice.

15 In a dream, during the night, when people are in deep sleep and lying in bed half-asleep;

16 Then he opens people's ears and gives them understanding.

17 To make a person change their plan and keep them from being proud.

18 He protects his soul from the pit and his life from dying by the sword.

19 He suffers with pain on his bed, and his bones ache greatly.

20 So he hates bread, and he refuses good food.

21 His body wastes away, hidden from sight; and his bones, once unseen, now stick out.

22 Yes, his soul is close to death, and his life nears those who destroy.

23 If a messenger is with him, an interpreter, one in a thousand, to show a person how to be right:

24 Then he is kind to him and says, Save him from falling into the pit: I have found a payment.

25 His body will be more refreshed than a child's: he will become young again.

26 He will pray to God, and God will accept him; he will see God's face with happiness because God will give man what is right.

27 He looks at people, and if anyone says, "I have sinned, I have twisted what is right, and it did not benefit me;"

28 He will save his soul from falling into the pit, and his life will see the light.

29 Look, God often does all these things with humans.

30 To save his life from the grave, to enjoy the light of life.

31 Pay attention, Job, listen to me: be quiet, and I will talk.

32 If you have something to say, reply: speak, because I want to clear you.

33 If not, listen to me: be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.
