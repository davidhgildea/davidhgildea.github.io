1 Do you know when the wild goats give birth? Can you tell when the deer are having their young?

2 Can you count how many months they need? Or do you know when they give birth?

3 They bend down, they give birth to their young, they let go of their pain.

4 Their young are healthy, they grow up with grain; they leave and do not come back.

5 Who set the wild donkey free? Who untied the ropes of the wild donkey?

6 I made the wilderness his house and the empty land his home.

7 He mocks the city's crowd and ignores the driver's shouts.

8 The mountains are where his animals graze, and he looks for every plant that is green.

9 Will the unicorn want to work for you or stay by your feeding trough?

10 Can you tie the unicorn with a rope in the fields? Or will he plow the valleys behind you?

11 Will you trust him because he is strong? Or will you rely on him to do your work?

12 Will you trust him to bring back your crops and collect them into your barn?

13 Did you give the beautiful wings to the peacocks? Or the wings and feathers to the ostrich?

14 She leaves her eggs on the ground and keeps them warm with the dirt.

15 And forgets that a foot might crush them, or a wild animal might destroy them.

16 She is cold toward her young, as if they were not hers; her hard work is pointless without concern.

17 God has not given her wisdom, nor has he given her understanding.

18 When she rises up, she looks down on the horse and its rider.

19 Did you give the horse its strength? Did you make its neck strong like thunder?

20 Can you scare him like a grasshopper? His strong breath is frightening.

21 He digs in the valley, happy in his power; he moves towards the armed men.

22 He laughs at fear, is not scared, and does not turn away from the sword.

23 The arrows shake against him, the shining spear and the shield.

24 He charges across the land with anger and fury; he does not think the trumpet sound is real.

25 He says among the trumpets, "Ha, ha"; and he senses the battle from far away, the noise of the commanders, and the yelling.

26 Does the hawk fly by your wisdom and spread its wings to the south?

27 Does the eagle fly up on your order and build her nest up high?

28 She lives and stays on the rock, at the top of the cliff, and in the secure spot.

29 From there she looks for food, and her eyes see from far away.

30 Her young ones also drink blood: and where there are dead bodies, there she is.
