1 I am tired of my life; I will not hold back my complaints; I will speak from my heart's bitterness.

2 I will tell God, "Do not judge me; tell me why you argue with me."

3 Is it right for you to be unfair, to reject what you have created, and to favor the plans of the evil?

4 Do you have human eyes? Or do you see as a person sees?

5 Are your days like a human's days? Are your years like a person's years?

6 You ask about my wrongs and search for my sins?

7 You know I am not wicked; no one can rescue from your hand.

8 Your hands made and shaped me completely; but now you are destroying me.

9 Please remember you created me from clay; will you turn me back into dust?

10 Did you not pour me out like milk and thicken me like cheese?

11 You dressed me with skin and flesh, and built me with bones and muscles.

12 You have given me life and kindness, and your care has kept my spirit safe.

13 You have kept these things hidden in your heart; I know you understand this.

14 If I do wrong, you notice it, and you will not clear me of my guilt.

15 If I am evil, trouble is upon me; and if I am good, I still can't hold my head high. I am totally confused; so see my suffering.

16 It grows. You chase me like a fierce lion, and then you do amazing things to me again.

17 You create new evidence against me and grow angrier with me; changes and conflict oppose me.

18 Why did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before anyone saw me!

19 I would have been like I never existed; I would have been taken from birth to the grave.

20 Aren't my days short? Stop and leave me be, so I can have a little comfort.

21 Before I go to a place I cannot come back from, to the land of darkness and death's shadow;

22 A land of total darkness, like the deepest darkness; a place of death's shadow, without any order, where even the light is dark.
