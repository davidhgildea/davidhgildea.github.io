1 I have seen all this with my eyes; my ears have heard and understood it.

2 I know what you know; I am not less than you.

3 I want to talk to God Almighty, and I wish to discuss with God.

4 You create lies and your healing is worthless.

5 I wish you would all be completely quiet! It would be wise for you.

6 Listen to my arguments and pay attention to what I say.

7 Will you speak wrongly for God and talk with lies for him?

8 Will you favor him? Will you argue for God?

9 Is it right for him to investigate you? Like one person teases another, do you tease him?

10 God will certainly correct you if you unfairly favor some people in secret.

11 Won't his greatness scare you? And his fear come on you?

12 Your memories are like ashes, your forms like clay.

13 Stay quiet, leave me be, so I can talk, and whatever happens, let it happen.

14 Why do I risk my life and take my own life into my hands?

15 Even if he kills me, I will still trust in God; but I will defend my own actions to him.

16 He will also be my savior, because a hypocrite will not come before Him.

17 Listen carefully to what I say and hear my explanation with your ears.

18 Look, I have prepared my case; I know I will be proven right.

19 Who will argue with me? For if I stay silent now, I will die.

20 Please don't do two things to me; then I won't hide from you.

21 Stop punishing me, and don't scare me anymore.

22 Then you call, and I will answer; or let me talk, and you reply to me.

23 What are my wrongs and sins? Show me what I have done wrong and my sin.

24 Why do you hide your face and treat me like your enemy?

25 Will you break a leaf blown back and forth? And will you chase the dry straw?

26 You write harsh things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth.

27 You put my feet in chains and watch all my ways closely; you leave a mark on the soles of my feet.

28 He decays like something rotten, like clothing eaten by moths.
