1 Job kept on speaking in his story, and said,

2 I wish I were back in the old days when God took care of me;

3 When his light glowed above me, and I walked in the dark by his light;

4 When I was young and God's friendship was with me in my home;

5 When God was still with me and my children were around me;

6 When I washed my feet with cream, and the stones gave me streams of oil;

7 When I went through the city to the gate, when I set up my seat in the public square!

8 The young men saw me and hid, while the older men stood up in respect.

9 The leaders stopped speaking and put their hand over their mouth.

10 The important people stayed quiet, and their tongue stuck to the top of their mouth.

11 When people heard me, they praised me; when they saw me, they approved of me.

12 I helped the poor who called out, the orphan, and the person who had no one to help them.

13 The blessing of someone close to death came to me; and I made the widow's heart joyful.

14 I wore what was right, and it covered me: my fairness was like a robe and a crown.

15 I was eyes for the blind and feet for the lame.

16 I was like a father to the poor and I investigated issues that I did not know about.

17 I broke the wicked's jaw and took away the stolen goods from his teeth.

18 Then I said, I will die peacefully at home, and live as long as the grains of sand.

19 My roots stretched out to the water, and the dew stayed on my branches all night.

20 My honor was strong within me, and my strength was restored in my grip.

21 People listened to me, waited, and stayed quiet for my advice.

22 After I spoke, they did not reply; my words fell on them.

23 They waited for me like for the rain; and they opened their mouths wide for the late rain.

24 If I smiled at them, they did not trust it; they did not make my happy face sad.

25 I picked their path, sat as the leader, and lived like a king among the troops, comforting those who grieve.
