1 But Job replied and spoke,

2 I wish my sorrow could be fully measured, and my troubles put on scales at the same time.

3 It's heavier than sea sand now; that's why I can't express my words.

4 God's arrows are inside me, their poison drains my spirit; God's terrors line up against me.

5 Does the wild donkey call out when it has grass? Or does the ox moo over its feed?

6 Can you eat tasteless food without salt? Or is there any flavor in egg whites?

7 The things I didn't want to touch now feel like my sad food.

8 I wish I could get what I ask for, and that God would give me what I deeply desire.

9 I wish God would decide to crush me, release his grip, and end my life.

10 Then I would still be comforted. Even though I suffer, I would be brave. Let God not hold back, because I have not hidden the words of God.

11 What strength do I have to hope? What is my future that I should extend my life?

12 Am I as strong as rocks? Is my body made of bronze?

13 Isn't my help within me? And has wisdom completely left me?

14 A friend should be kind to someone who is suffering, but he ignores respecting God.

15 My brothers have been as unreliable as a stream, like the water in streams that disappears.

16 They are dark because of the ice, and snow is hidden in them.

17 When they get warm, they disappear; when it's hot, they are gone from where they were.

18 Their paths have changed direction; they lead to nowhere and end in destruction.

19 The soldiers from Tema searched, and the groups from Sheba waited for them.

20 They were confused because they had hope; they went there and felt embarrassed.

21 You are now worth nothing; you see my downfall, and you are scared.

22 Did I ask you to bring something to me or to give me a gift from what you own?

23 Save me from my enemyâ€™s grasp, or rescue me from the clutches of the powerful?

24 Instruct me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have made mistakes.

25 How powerful are true words! But what does your arguing prove?

26 Do you think you can correct mere words when someone in despair speaks as if they are just wind?

27 Yes, you overpower the orphans and trap your friend.

28 So now, be satisfied and look at me; it is clear to you if I am lying.

29 Please come back, don't think it's wrong; yes, come back, my goodness is in it.

30 Is there wrongdoing in my words? Can't I tell what is wrong?
