1 Zophar from Naamath spoke and said,

2 So my thoughts make me reply quickly.

3 I have heard the criticism against me, and my insight makes me respond.

4 Don't you know this from long ago, since the time humans were put on earth?

5 The success of the wicked is brief, and the happiness of the dishonest lasts only a moment.

6 Even if he becomes very important and his pride reaches the sky,

7 He will die forever like his waste; those who saw him will ask, "Where is he?"

8 He will vanish like a dream and not be found; he will be driven away like a night vision.

9 The eye that saw him will never see him again; his place will no longer see him.

10 His kids will try to help the poor, and his hands will give back their things.

11 His bones carry the sins of his youth, which will go down with him to the dirt.

12 Even if wrongdoing tastes sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue;

13 Even if he doesn't hurt it but leaves it in his mouth without letting it go:

14 The food in his stomach has changed; it is like snake poison inside him.

15 He has consumed wealth, and he will spit it out again: God will force it from his stomach.

16 He will suck the snake's poison: the viper's tongue will kill him.

17 He will not see the rivers, the floods, or the streams of honey and cream.

18 He must give back what he worked for and cannot keep it; he will return an amount equal to his wealth, but he will not be happy about it.

19 Because he hurt and left the poor; because he took a house by force that he did not build.

20 He will not find peace within, nor keep what he wanted.

21 All his food will be gone; so no one will search for his possessions.

22 When he feels most secure, he will be in trouble; every hand of the wicked will attack him.

23 When he's about to eat, God will throw his anger at him and make it fall on him as he eats.

24 He will run from the iron weapon, and a steel bow will shoot him.

25 It is pulled out, and comes from the body; yes, the shiny sword comes from his liver: fears are on him.

26 Darkness will hide in his hidden places; a fire not fanned will eat him up; things will go badly for anyone remaining in his tent.

27 The sky will show his wrongs; and the ground will stand against him.

28 His wealth will disappear, and his possessions will be lost when God is angry.

29 This is what a bad person gets from God, the share given to him by God.
