1 In the land of Uz, there lived a man named Job. He was blameless and honest, feared God, and avoided evil.

2 He had seven sons and three daughters.

3 He also had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pairs of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a huge family. So he was the richest man in the east.

4 His sons had parties in their own homes, each on his special day; and they invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.

5 When the feasting days were over, Job would make his children holy, get up early, and give burnt offerings for each one. He thought, "Maybe my sons have done wrong and thought bad things about God." Job did this all the time.

6 One day, the children of God gathered in front of God, and Satan joined them too.

7 God asked Satan, "Where do you come from?" Satan answered God, "I have been roaming around the earth, going back and forth on it."

8 God said to Satan, "Have you noticed my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth, a perfect and honest man who respects God and avoids evil."

9 Then Satan replied to God, "Does Job respect God for nothing?"

10 Haven't you protected him, his house, and everything he has on all sides? You have blessed what he does, and his wealth has grown in the land.

11 Reach out now and strike everything he owns, and he will surely insult you to your face.

12 God said to Satan, "Look, all he has is under your control; but do not hurt him." So Satan left God's presence.

13 One day his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the oldest brother's house.

14 A messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were eating nearby."

15 The Sabeans attacked and captured them; they killed the workers with swords; I alone escaped to tell you.

16 While he was still talking, another person came and said, "Fire from God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the workers, and I'm the only one who got away to tell you."

17 While he was still talking, another person came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three groups, attacked the camels, took them, and also killed the workers with swords; only I have escaped to tell you."

18 While he was still talking, another one came and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house."

19 Suddenly, a strong wind from the desert struck all four sides of the house, and it collapsed on the young men, and they died; I am the only one who got away to tell you.

20 Then Job stood up, tore his robe, shaved his head, fell to the ground, and worshiped.

21 I was born with nothing, and I will die with nothing: God gave, and God has taken away; praise God's name.

22 In all this, Job did not sin or blame God wrongly.
