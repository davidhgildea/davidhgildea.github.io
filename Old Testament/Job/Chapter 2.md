1 Once more, a time came when God's children appeared before God, and Satan also arrived with them to present himself before God.

2 God asked Satan, "Where did you come from?" Satan replied to God, "I've been roaming around the earth and walking back and forth on it."

3 God said to Satan, "Have you noticed my servant Job? There's no one like him on earth. He's a perfect and honest man who respects God and stays away from evil. Yet he keeps his goodness, even though you convinced me to harm him for no reason."

4 And Satan replied to God, "Surely one will give everything they have to save their own life."

5 Reach out now and hurt his bones and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your face.

6 God said to Satan, "Look, he is in your power, but spare his life."

7 Satan left from being with God and gave Job painful sores from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head.

8 He took a piece of broken pottery to scratch himself with and sat down in the ashes.

9 His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your goodness? Curse God and die."

10 He told her, "You talk like a foolish woman. Should we accept only good from God and not trouble?" Despite everything, Job did not say anything wrong.

11 When Job's three friends learned about all the bad things that had happened to him, each came from his own home: Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah. They had agreed to meet and go to sympathize with him and to comfort him.

12 When they looked up and didn't recognize him from far away, they cried out loud, tore their clothes, and threw dust on their heads, looking up to the sky.

13 They sat with him on the ground for seven days and nights without speaking because they saw his sorrow was very deep.
