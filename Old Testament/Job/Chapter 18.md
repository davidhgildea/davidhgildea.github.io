1 Bildad the Shuhite replied and said,

2 How long until you stop talking? Pay attention, and then we will speak.

3 Why are we treated like animals and considered disgusting to you?

4 He hurts himself in his anger: should the world be abandoned for you? And should the stone be moved from its spot?

5 Yes, the wicked's light will go out, and their fire's spark won't shine.

6 The light in his tent will become dark, and his lamp will go out with him.

7 His strong steps will become tight, and his own plans will make him fall.

8 He is trapped in a net by his own steps and walks on a trap.

9 A trap will catch him by the foot, and a thief will defeat him.

10 A trap is set for him on the ground, and a snare is in his path.

11 Fears will scare him from all around and make him run away.

12 His strength will be weakened by hunger, and ruin will stand by his side.

13 It will eat away the power of his skin; death's firstborn will consume his power.

14 His trust will be pulled up from his home, and it will take him to the king of fears.

15 It will live in its tent, for it is not its own; sulfur will be spread over its home.

16 His roots will dry up below, and his branches will be cut off above.

17 People will forget him on earth, and his name will not be spoken in public.

18 He will be forced from light to darkness, and driven away from the world.

19 He won't have a son or nephew among his people, or anyone left in his home.

20 Those who follow him will be amazed at his time, just as those before were terrified.

21 These are surely the homes of the evil, and this is where someone who does not know God lives.
