1 Bildad the Shuhite replied and said,

2 God has power and is respected; he makes peace in his heavens.

3 Can anyone count his armies? And who doesn't his light shine on?

4 How can a person be right with God? How can someone born of a woman be pure?

5 Look at the moon, it does not glow; even the stars are not clean in God's eyes.

6 How much less is a person, a worm, and a human being, who is also a worm?
