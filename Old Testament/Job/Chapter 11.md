1 Zophar from Naama replied, saying,

2 Shouldn't many words get a reply? And should a chatty person be right?

3 Do your lies make people stay silent? When you mock, doesn't anyone make you feel ashamed?

4 You have said, "My teaching is pure, and I am clean in your sight."

5 I wish God would speak and tell you off.

6 God wants to show you the deep secrets of wisdom, which are twice as much as what exists. Understand then that God asks from you less than your wrongs deserve.

7 Can you find out about God by searching? Can you fully understand the Almighty?

8 It's as high as the sky; what can you do? It's deeper than the deepest place; what can you know?

9 Its size is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.

10 If he decides, closes in, or brings together, then who can stop him?

11 For he knows foolish people: he sees evil too; won't he think about it?

12 Empty-headed people want to seem wise, even though they are born as wild as a donkey's foal.

13 If you get your heart ready and reach out your hands to him;

14 If you hold wrongdoing in your hand, put it far from you, and do not let evil live in your homes.

15 You will be able to hold your head high without guilt; yes, you will be steady and without fear.

16 You will forget your troubles, and think of them like water that has gone by.

17 Your future will be brighter than midday: you will glow, you will be like the dawn.

18 You will be safe because there is hope; yes, you will look around and lie down without fear.

19 You will lie down without fear; many will come to ask for your favor.

20 The wicked will lose their sight, won't get away, and their hope will vanish like a dying breath.
