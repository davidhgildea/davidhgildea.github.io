1 On that day, God with His fierce, mighty sword will punish Leviathan, the sharp serpent, even Leviathan, the twisted serpent; and He will kill the sea dragon.

2 On that day, sing to her, "A vineyard of red wine."

3 I am God and I take care of it; I will water it all the time so that no one damages it, I will protect it day and night.

4 I am not angry: who would challenge me with briers and thorns in battle? I would march through them, I would burn them all.

5 Let him grab my power so he can be at peace with me, and he will be at peace with me.

6 He will help the descendants of Jacob to grow strong: Israel will bloom and flourish and spread their fruit all over the world.

7 Did God strike him as he struck those who attacked him? Or was he killed like those he killed?

8 When it grows, you will argue with it, but God calms the strong wind on the east wind's day.

9 Through this, Jacob's wrongdoing will be cleansed, and completely removing his sin will come from turning all the altar stones into crushed chalk; the sacred poles and idols will no longer remain standing.

10 The protected city will become empty, the place left and forgotten like a desert: there the calf will graze, lie down, and eat its branches.

11 When its branches dry up, they get broken off. Women come to burn them. These people don't understand, so the one who created them will not pity them, and the one who shaped them will not be kind to them.

12 On that day, God will clear the land from the Euphrates River to the brook of Egypt, and you, the people of Israel, will be gathered one by one.

13 On that day, a loud trumpet will sound, and those about to die in Assyria, along with the exiles in Egypt, will return and worship God on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
