1 On that day, seven women will grab one man and say, "We will eat our own food and wear our own clothes; just let us have your name to remove our shame."

2 On that day, God's branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the earth's produce will be outstanding and attractive for the survivors in Israel.

3 Everyone who stays in Zion and survives in Jerusalem will be called holy, each one listed among the living in Jerusalem.

4 When God cleans the dirt from Zion's daughters and removes Jerusalem's blood by judging and burning.

5 God will make a cloud and smoke over every home on Mount Zion and over its gatherings by day, and a bright, burning fire by night; all the splendid things will have protection.

6 There will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat during the day, and a safe place to protect from storms and rain.
