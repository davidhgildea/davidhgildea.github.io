1 Pity those who look to Egypt for help, relying on horses, trusting in many chariots and strong horsemen, but not turning to Israel's Holy One or seeking God!

2 He is wise too and will cause trouble. He won't take back his words; instead, he will stand up against the bad people's house and those who do wrong.

3 The Egyptians are human, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When God reaches out, both the helper and the helped will fall, and they will all fail together.

4 God told me, like a lion or a young lion growling over its catch, isn't scared when shepherds come against it and doesn't care about their noise, so will God come to fight for Mount Zion and its hill.

5 Like birds flying, God will protect Jerusalem; He will also save it and watch over it.

6 Turn back to God, who the people of Israel have greatly turned away from.

7 On that day, everyone will throw away their silver and gold idols, which you made with your hands and which cause you to sin.

8 Then the Assyrian will be defeated by the sword, not by a powerful man; and the sword, not by an ordinary man, will destroy him. But he will run away from the sword, and his soldiers will be scattered.

9 He will go to his strong place because he is scared, and his leaders will fear the flag, says God, who has fire in Zion and a furnace in Jerusalem.
