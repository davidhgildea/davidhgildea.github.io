1 Still, the gloom won't be as heavy as the trouble she first had, when God at first only slightly punished the land of Zebulun and Naphtali, and later punished it much more harshly by the sea, past Jordan, in the area of the nations.

2 People who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who lived in the land where death casts its shadow, on them the light has shone.

3 You have made the nation larger, but not made its joy greater. They are happy in your presence like they are happy at harvest time, and like people rejoicing when they share out what they have taken.

4 For you have shattered the weight he carried and the stick on his shoulder, the club of his enemy, just like in the time of Midian.

5 Every warrior's battle involves chaos and bloody clothes; but this fight will be with burning and fire's fuel.

6 A child is born to us, a son is given to us; he will govern, and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

7 His government and peace will grow forever. He will rule on David's throne and over his kingdom, setting it up and making it secure, fair, and just from now on and always. God's passionate commitment will make this happen.

8 God sent a message to Jacob, and it arrived in Israel.

9 Everyone, including Ephraim and the people of Samaria who speak with pride and strong hearts, will know,

10 The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with cut stones; the sycamores have been chopped down, but we will replace them with cedars.

11 So God will make Rezin's enemies attack him and cause his foes to unite.

12 The Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind, will attack and consume Israel completely. Despite this, God remains angry, and his power is still at work.

13 The people do not turn to the one who strikes them, nor do they look for God.

14 So God will remove the leaders and followers from Israel, as well as everything else, in one day.

15 The old and respected person is the leader; and the false teacher is the least important.

16 The leaders of these people lead them astray, and those who follow them are ruined.

17 So, God will not be happy with their young men, nor will he show kindness to the orphans and widows, because everyone is fake and does bad things, and all they say is foolish. Despite all this, God is still angry and ready to act.

18 Evil acts burn like fire: they will consume the briars and thorns, and will spread in the dense parts of the forest, rising up like smoke.

19 God's anger has made the land dark, and the people will burn like fuel for the fire; no one will show mercy to his brother.

20 He will grab with his right hand and still be hungry; he will eat with his left hand and not be satisfied. Each person will eat the flesh of their own arm.

21 Manasseh and Ephraim will fight each other, but together they will fight against Judah. Despite this, God is still angry and continues to punish.
