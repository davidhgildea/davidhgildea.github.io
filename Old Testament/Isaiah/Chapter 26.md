1 On that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; God makes salvation our walls and defenses."

2 Open the gates so the nation that keeps the truth can come in.

3 You will keep the person in perfect peace whose thoughts are fixed on you, because he trusts in you.

4 Trust in God always, for God has endless strength.

5 He brings down those who live up high; the tall city, he makes it flat; he flattens it to the ground; he reduces it to dust.

6 Feet will trample it, the feet of the poor and the steps of those in need.

7 The path of good people is straight: you, the fairest, judge the way of the good.

8 Yes, following your decisions, God, we have waited for you; our soul's longing is for your name and to remember you.

9 I long for you with all my heart at night; indeed, I will search for you early with my spirit. When your decisions are known on earth, the people of the world will understand what is right.

10 Even if the wicked are shown kindness, they still do not learn what is right. They act unfairly in a good land and do not respect the greatness of God.

11 God, when you raise your hand, they don't see it: but they will see and feel shame for their jealousy of the people; indeed, the fire meant for your enemies will consume them.

12 God, you will give us peace, because you have done all our deeds for us.

13 God, our God, other rulers besides you have ruled over us, but we will only honor your name.

14 They are dead, they will not live; they are gone, they will not rise again. So, you have punished and wiped them out, erasing all memory of them.

15 You have grown the nation, God, you have made the nation larger; you are honored; you have spread it to the farthest parts of the earth.

16 God, in trouble they seek you, they pray deeply when you discipline them.

17 Just as a pregnant woman about to give birth hurts and cries out in her pain, so we have been before you, God.

18 We have been pregnant, we have been in pain, we have only produced wind; we have not brought any salvation on the earth; nor have the world's people fallen.

19 Your dead will live; my dead body and they will rise. Wake up and sing, you in the dust: your dew is like the plants' dew, and the earth will let out the dead.

20 Come, my people, go into your rooms and close your doors behind you. Hide for a short time until the anger has passed.

21 Look, God is coming from his place to punish the people of the world for their wrongs. The earth will reveal the blood spilled on it and will not hide those who were killed anymore.
