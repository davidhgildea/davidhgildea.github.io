1 On that day, you will say, "God, I will praise you. Even though you were angry with me, your anger has gone, and you have comforted me."

2 Look, God is my savior; I will trust and not fear: for God is my strength and my song; he has also become my savior.

3 So with happiness you will get water from the springs of rescue.

4 On that day you will say, "Praise God, ask for his help, tell everyone what he has done, and remember that his name is great."

5 Sing to God; for He has done wonderful things: this is known all over the earth.

6 Shout loudly, you who live in Zion, because the Holy One of Israel is great among you.
