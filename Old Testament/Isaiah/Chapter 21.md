1 The heavy message about the sea desert. Like storms in the south move through; it comes from the desert, from a scary land.

2 A terrible vision is told to me; the cheater cheats, and the destroyer destroys. Attack, Elam: surround, Media; I have ended all its groaning.

3 My waist is full of pain; cramps have gripped me, like a woman in labor. I was bent over when I heard it; I was shocked when I saw it.

4 My heart beat fast, and fear scared me: the night that was once joyful for me has become a time of fear.

5 Set the table, stay alert in the tower, eat and drink: get up, leaders, and get the shield ready.

6 God told me, "Go, put a guard on duty, and let him report what he sees."

7 He saw a chariot with two horsemen, a donkey chariot, and a camel chariot; and he listened carefully with great attention.

8 He shouted, "A lion! Sir, I'm always on the lookout during the day, and I stay at my guard post all night."

9 Look, here comes a chariot with two riders. He replied, "Babylon has fallen, has fallen; and all the idols of its gods are shattered on the ground."

10 My people, whom I will thresh and the grain of my threshing floor: what I've heard from God, the God of Israel, I have told you.

11 The heavy message of Dumah. Someone from Seir calls to me, “Guard, how much of the night is left? Guard, how much of the night is left?”

12 The guard said, "Morning is coming, and also the night. If you want to ask, then ask. Come back, come."

13 The heavy task is on Arabia. You will stay in the woods in Arabia, you traveling groups of Dedanites.

14 The people of Tema brought water to the thirsty and gave bread to the fugitives.

15 They ran away from the swords, the pulled-out sword, the bent bow, and the harshness of war.

16 God told me that within one year, like the time a hired worker counts, all Kedar's pride will disappear.

17 The remaining archers from the strong warriors of Kedar's descendants will decrease because God of Israel has said so.
