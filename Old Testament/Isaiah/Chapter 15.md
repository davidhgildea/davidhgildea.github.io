1 Moab's heavy problem. Because at night, Moab's city Ar is destroyed and silenced; at night, Moab's city Kir is also destroyed and silenced.

2 He has gone up to Bajith and Dibon's high places to cry. Moab will wail for Nebo and Medeba. Everyone will be bald and every beard shaved off.

3 In their streets, they will wear rough cloth: on their house roofs and in the streets, everyone will cry loudly, shedding many tears.

4 Heshbon and Elealeh will cry out, their voices heard all the way to Jahaz. So, Moab's armed men will scream; his life will be hard for him.

5 I will cry for Moab; its people will run to Zoar, like a young cow: They will cry while going up the hill of Luhith; on the road to Horonaim, they will shout because everything is destroyed.

6 The waters of Nimrim will become empty; the hay has dried up, the grass is gone, and nothing green is left.

7 So they will take away the wealth they have gathered and stored to the Brook of Willows.

8 The cry has spread all around Moab's borders; the wailing reaches Eglaim, and the wailing extends to Beerelim.

9 The waters of Dimon will be filled with blood because I will send more troubles to Dimon, lions to attack those from Moab who escape, and those who are left in the land.
