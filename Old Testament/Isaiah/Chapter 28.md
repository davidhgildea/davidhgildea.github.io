1 Trouble is coming for the proud crown, for the drunk people of Ephraim, whose beautiful glory is like a dying flower, on the head of the rich valleys of those drunk with wine.

2 Look, God has a powerful and strong one who, like a hailstorm and a destructive storm, like a big flood of overflowing waters, will throw down to the ground with force.

3 The proud crown, the drunk people of Ephraim, will be stepped on.

4 The beautiful crown of the fertile valley will wither away like a flower, and be like early fruit before summer; when someone sees it, they will eat it as soon as it's in their hand.

5 On that day, God will be like a crown of glory and a beautiful tiara for the remaining people.

6 To give discernment to those who judge and power to those who push back enemies to their gates.

7 But they have made mistakes because of wine, and strong drink has led them astray; the priest and the prophet have made errors because of strong drink, they are overwhelmed by wine, they wander off the path because of strong drink; they make mistakes in their visions, they trip up in their decisions.

8 Every table is covered with vomit and dirty, leaving no clean spot.

9 Who will he teach knowledge? Who will he help understand the teachings? Those who have outgrown milk and no longer nurse.

10 Rule should be followed by rule; line by line; here a bit, there a bit.

11 With unclear speech and a different language, he will talk to these people.

12 He said to them, "This is the place where you can give rest to the tired, and here they can be refreshed. But they wouldn't listen."

13 God's teaching was given to them bit by bit, rule by rule; here a little, there a little, so they might stumble, fall, and be caught.

14 Listen to God's message, you mocking leaders of the people in Jerusalem.

15 Because you said, "We have an agreement with death and a deal with the grave; when disaster sweeps by, it won't reach us: for we've made lies our shelter, and under untruths we've hidden."

16 So God says, "Look, I place in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tested stone, a valuable cornerstone, a solid foundation. Whoever believes will not rush."

17 I will use justice as a measuring line and righteousness as a plumb line; hail will destroy the shelter of lies, and water will flood the hiding place.

18 Your deal with death will be canceled, and your pact with the grave will not last; when the sweeping punishment comes through, you will be crushed by it.

19 Once it starts, it will sweep over you; every morning and night it will come, and just hearing the news will be very distressing.

20 The bed is too short for someone to stretch out on, and the blanket too small to wrap around oneself.

21 God will rise up like he did at Mount Perazim, he will be angry like he was in the Valley of Gibeon, to do what he must, his unusual work; and to complete his task, his unexpected task.

22 So now, don't mock or your punishment will grow. I have heard from God that he has decided to destroy the entire earth.

23 Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear my words.

24 Does the farmer plow all day to plant seeds? Does he break up the lumps of soil on his land?

25 When he has smoothed out the ground, doesn't he spread the fitches and scatter the cumin, and put the best wheat, the chosen barley, and the rye where they belong?

26 God guides him with wisdom and teaches him.

27 You don't use a heavy tool to thresh the fitches, nor do you drive a cart wheel over the cummin; instead, you beat the fitches with a stick and the cummin with a rod.

28 Grain for bread is crushed, but not forever; it won't be ground endlessly or broken with the cart's wheel, nor smashed by horse riders.

29 This also comes from God, who is amazing in giving advice and outstanding in what He does.
