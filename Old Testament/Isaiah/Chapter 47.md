</div>
1 Come down and sit in the dirt, you pure girl of Babylon. Sit on the ground. You have no throne, girl of the Chaldeans, because you won't be called soft and gentle anymore.

2 Use the grinding stones to make flour, let down your hair, show your legs, reveal your thighs, and cross the rivers.

3 Your nakedness will be exposed, and your shame will be seen: I will get revenge, and I will not face you like a human.

4 Our rescuer is God, the ruler of all, called the Holy One of Israel.

5 Stay quiet and go into the dark, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you will no longer be known as the queen of nations.

6 I was angry with my people, I have made my inheritance impure, and handed them over to you: you showed them no mercy; you laid a very heavy burden on the old.

7 You said, "I will always be a lady," so you didn't take these things seriously or think about what would happen later.

8 Listen to this, you who love pleasures and live carelessly, thinking to yourself, "I am the only one; there's no one besides me. I will never be a widow or know the loss of children."

9 Two things will suddenly happen to you: you'll lose your children and become a widow. These will fully hit you because of your many magic tricks and spells.

10 You trusted in your wrongdoing, thinking no one sees you. Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray, and you told yourself, "I exist, and there is no one else like me."

11 Bad things will happen to you; you won't know where they come from. Trouble will hit you, and you won't be able to stop it. Sudden ruin will happen to you, and you won't see it coming.

12 Stand now with your magic spells and the many sorceries you've worked on since your youth; perhaps you will succeed, maybe you will inspire fear.

13 You are tired from all your advice. Now let the astrologers, the stargazers, and those who predict each month try to stand up and save you from what is going to happen to you.

14 Look, they will be like dry grass; the fire will burn them up; they won't be able to save themselves from the flames. There won't be a single coal to warm up by, or a fire to sit in front of.

15 They that worked with you and traded with you since your youth will all go their own ways; no one will help you.
