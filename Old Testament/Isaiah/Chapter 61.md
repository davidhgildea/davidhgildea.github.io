</figure>
1 God's Spirit is with me; for God has chosen me to bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to heal those with broken hearts, to announce freedom for the captives, and to open the prison for those who are tied up.

2 To announce the year God favors and the day God will take revenge; to comfort all who are sad.

3 God aims to comfort those who grieve in Zion, to give them beauty instead of ashes, joyful oil instead of mourning, and clothes of praise instead of a heavy heart, so they will be like strong, good trees planted by God to show his greatness.

4 They will rebuild the ruined places, they will restore the old ruins, and they will fix the destroyed cities, the places ruined for many years.

5 Foreigners will care for your sheep, and people from other places will farm your land and tend your vineyards.

6 You will be called God's priests; people will call you God's servants. You will enjoy the wealth of other nations, and you will take pride in their splendor.

7 You will receive twice as much instead of your shame; they will celebrate their share instead of feeling embarrassed. So in their land, they will own twice as much, and they will have endless joy.

8 For I, God, love fairness, I hate theft in sacrifices; and I will guide their work in truth, and I will form a lasting agreement with them.

9 Their children will be recognized by other nations, and their descendants by all peoples; everyone who sees them will know that they are children whom God has blessed.

10 I will be very happy with God, my soul will be joyful in my God; because he has dressed me in the clothes of rescue, he has wrapped me with the coat of being right, like a groom gets ready with fancy things, and like a bride decorates herself with her gems.

11 Just like the earth produces its sprouts and a garden makes its planted seeds grow, God will make fairness and praise blossom in front of all countries.
