1 In the year Tartan came to Ashdod, sent by Sargon, the king of Assyria, and attacked and captured it.

2 At that time, God told Isaiah, son of Amoz, "Go, take the sackcloth off your waist, and remove your shoe from your foot." And he did it, going around naked and without shoes.

3 And God said, "Just as my servant Isaiah walked without clothes and barefoot for three years as a sign and miracle for Egypt and Ethiopia;

4 The king of Assyria will take the Egyptians and Ethiopians as prisoners, both young and old, without clothes and shoes, their backsides exposed, to embarrass Egypt.

5 They will feel fear and shame about their hope in Ethiopia and their pride in Egypt.

6 On that day, the people of this island will say, "Look, this is what we hoped for, where we ran for help to save us from the king of Assyria: but how can we escape?"
