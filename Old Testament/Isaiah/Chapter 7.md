1 During the time of Ahaz, Jotham's son, and grandson of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah, Remaliah's son and king of Israel, attacked Jerusalem but could not defeat it.

2 The house of David was informed, "Syria has joined forces with Ephraim." Then his and his people's hearts shook like trees in the forest shake in the wind.

3 God told Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz, along with your son Shearjashub, at the end of the water channel of the upper pool on the road to the launderer's field."

4 Tell him, "Be careful and stay calm; don't be afraid or weak because of the dying fires of Rezin's anger with Syria, and the son of Remaliah."

5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and Remaliah's son have planned something bad against you, saying,

6 Let's attack Judah, trouble it, make a gap for us, and place Tabeal's son as king there.

7 God says, "It will not happen, nor will it take place."

8 Syria's capital is Damascus, and Damascus's leader is Rezin. In 65 years, Ephraim will be destroyed and no longer be a nation.

9 Ephraim's capital is Samaria, and the leader of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you don't believe, you will not last.

10 God spoke to Ahaz again, saying,

11 Ask for a sign from God; you can ask for it to be deep down or high up.

12 Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I test God.

13 He said, "Listen, family of David; is it not enough for you to tire people? Will you also tire my God?"

14 God will give you a sign: A young woman will become pregnant, have a son, and name him Immanuel.

15 He will eat butter and honey to learn how to reject what is bad and choose what is good.

16 Before the child learns to reject evil and choose good, the land you hate will be abandoned by its two kings.

17 God will bring upon you, your people, and your ancestors' house, times unlike any since Ephraim separated from Judahâ€”the king of Assyria included.

18 In that day, God will call for the flies from Egypt's farthest rivers and the bees from Assyria.

19 They will come and rest in the empty valleys, in the rock crevices, and among all the thorny plants and bushes.

20 On that day, God will use a hired razor, from the people across the river, the king of Assyria, to shave the head, the hair on the feet, and also remove the beard.

21 On that day, a person will take care of a young cow and two sheep.

22 Because there will be so much milk, people will eat butter; everyone left in the land will eat butter and honey.

23 On that day, every place with a thousand grapevines, each worth a thousand silver coins, will be overtaken by weeds and thorns.

24 People will come there with arrows and bows, because the whole land will be covered with thorns and briers.

25 On every hill plowed with tools, there won't be fear of sharp plants; instead, it will be a place for oxen and for smaller animals to walk.
