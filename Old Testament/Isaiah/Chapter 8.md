1 God told me, "Get a large scroll and write on it with a normal pen about Mahershalalhashbaz."

2 I chose trustworthy people to witness, Uriah the priest and Zechariah, Jeberechiah's son.

3 I went to the prophetess; she became pregnant and had a son. Then God told me, "Name him Mahershalalhashbaz."

4 Before the child learns to say "My father" or "My mother," the wealth of Damascus and the goods of Samaria will be taken by the king of Assyria.

5 God spoke to me again, saying,

6 Since these people reject the gentle flowing waters of Shiloah and are happy with Rezin and the son of Remaliah;

7 Now then, see how God brings the river's strong and many waters against them, including the Assyrian king and his might. He will rise above all his streams and overflow all his banks.

8 He will pass through Judah, flooding and crossing over, reaching up to the neck; his stretched-out wings will cover the width of your land, Immanuel.

9 Join together, people, and you will be destroyed; listen, all you from distant lands: prepare for battle, and you will be destroyed; prepare for battle, and you will be destroyed.

10 Make plans together, but they will fail; say what you want, but it won't happen, because God is with us.

11 God spoke to me forcefully and taught me not to follow this people's ways, saying.

12 Don't call everything a conspiracy, like these people do, and don't fear what they fear; do not be terrified.

13 Make God your only holy one; fear him and be in awe of him.

14 He will be a safe place, but also a stumbling stone and a rock that causes offense to both the families of Israel, and a trap and a snare to the people of Jerusalem.

15 Many of them will stumble, fall, get hurt, be caught, and be captured.

16 Keep the teaching safe, put the law in the hearts of my followers.

17 I will wait for God, who hides from the people of Jacob, and I will seek Him.

18 Look, I and the children God has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from God who lives on Mount Zion.

19 When people tell you to ask for help from those who talk to spirits and wizards who whisper and murmur, shouldn't you ask for help from your God instead of looking for answers among the dead?

20 Refer to God's law and message: if they do not agree with this, it is because they lack understanding.

21 They will go through it in great trouble and hunger, and when they are hungry, they will become upset, curse their king and God, and look up.

22 They will look to the earth and see distress and darkness, the gloom of suffering, and they will be pushed into darkness.
