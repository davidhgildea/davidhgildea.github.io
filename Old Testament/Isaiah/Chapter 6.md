1 The year King Uzziah died, I saw God on a high and exalted throne, and his robe filled the temple.

2 Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.

3 One called to another, saying, “Holy, holy, holy, is God of all: the whole earth is full of his glory.”

4 The door's posts shook with the sound of the shout, and the house was filled with smoke.

5 I said, "I'm in trouble! I am ruined because I have dirty lips and live among people with dirty lips, yet I have seen the King, God."

6 One of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand that he took from the altar with tongs.

7 He put it on my mouth and said, "See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is gone, and your sin is forgiven."

8 I also heard God's voice asking, "Who should I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here I am; send me."

9 He said, "Go and tell these people, 'You may hear, but you will not understand; you may see, but you will not know what you're seeing.'"

10 Make these people's hearts dull, their ears deaf, and blind their eyes; so they won't see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, turn back, and be healed.

11 I asked, "God, how long will this last?" And he replied, "Until the cities are empty, the houses have no one living in them, and the land is completely deserted."

12 God has taken people far away, and there is a big emptiness in the land.

13 In it, a tenth will remain, and it will revive and be used for food. Like a terebinth or an oak tree that keeps its strength even when it loses its leaves, so will the holy people be the strength of the land.
