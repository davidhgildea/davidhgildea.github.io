1 Listen, islands, to me; pay attention, you people from far away. God has called me from before I was born; from my mother's womb, he has spoken my name.

2 God has made my mouth like a sharp sword; he has hidden me in the shadow of his hand and made me like a smooth arrow stored in his quiver.

3 He told me, "You are my servant, Israel, and through you I will be honored."

4 Then I said, I have worked hard for nothing, I have used my energy for no reason, and it's all been pointless: but for sure, my reward is with God, and my work is with my God.

5 God, who made me in the womb to serve Him, to bring Jacob back to Him, says: Even if Israel isn't brought back together, I will still be honored in God's sight, and God will give me strength.

6 He said, "It is a small task for you to be my servant, to bring back the people of Jacob and to save the survivors of Israel. I will also make you a light for other nations so that you can be my salvation to the ends of the earth."

7 God, who saves Israel and is holy, says to the one people hate and nations reject, who serves rulers: Kings will see you and stand up, princes will see and bow down, because God is faithful and the holy one of Israel has chosen you.

8 God says, "I listened to you at the right time, and on the day you were saved, I helped you. I will keep you safe and make you a promise to the people, to rebuild the land and give new life to ruined places."

9 So you can tell the captives, "Go out," and to those in the dark, "Come into the light." They will find food along the roads, and they will graze on every hill.

10 They will not be hungry or thirsty; neither will the heat or sun hurt them, because the one who has mercy on them will lead them and guide them to water springs.

11 I will turn all my mountains into roads, and my paths will be raised up.

12 Look, these will come from far away: some from the north and the west, and others from the land of Sinim.

13 Sing, heavens, and earth be happy; mountains, burst into song: for God has comforted his people and will show kindness to those who are suffering.

14 But Zion said, God has left me, and my God has forgotten me.

15 Can a mother forget her baby or not feel love for her own child? Even if she could forget, I will never forget you.

16 Look, I have carved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are always in my sight.

17 Your children will hurry back; those who destroyed you and left you in ruins will leave you.

18 Look around and see: everyone is coming to you. As God lives, says God, you will wear them all like jewelry and dress yourself with them like a bride.

19 Because your ruined and empty places, and the land of your ruin, will now be too small for all the people, and those who devoured you will be gone.

20 The children you will have, after you've lost the others, will tell you, 'This place is too small for me; make room for me to live.'

21 Then you will think to yourself, "Who gave me these children when I lost mine and was all alone, a prisoner, and wandering? And who has raised these?" I was alone; where were these children before?

22 God says, "See, I will raise my hand to the nations and show my signal to the peoples. They will carry your sons in their arms and your daughters will be lifted on their shoulders."

23 Kings will care for you like fathers, and queens like mothers. They will bow down to you with their faces to the ground, and honor you like they are kissing your feet. Then you will know that I am God. Those who wait for me will not be ashamed.

24 Can the prize be taken from the strong, or the rightful prisoner set free?

25 But this is what God says: Even the prisoners of the strong will be taken, and the victims of the fearsome will be freed. I will fight against those who fight you, and I will save your children.

26 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood as if it were sweet wine. Then everyone will know that I, God, am your Savior and Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
