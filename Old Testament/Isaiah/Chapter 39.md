1 At that time, Merodachbaladan, son of Baladan and king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because he heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had gotten better.

2 Hezekiah was happy with them and showed them his treasury, the silver, gold, spices, fine oil, his armory, and everything in his treasures: he kept nothing hidden from them in his house or his rule.

3 Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say, and where did they come from to visit you?" Hezekiah replied, "They came to me from a distant country, from Babylon."

4 He asked, "What did they see in your house?" And Hezekiah replied, "They saw everything in my house; there's nothing in my treasures I didn't show them."

5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Listen to the message from God:"

6 The time will come when everything in your house and everything your ancestors saved up until now will be taken to Babylon; nothing will remain, says God.

7 From your children, whom you will father, they will take some to be eunuchs in the palace of the Babylonian king.

8 Hezekiah told Isaiah, "God's message you gave is good. Also, there will be peace and truth while I live."
