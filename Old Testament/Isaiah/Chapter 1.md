</div>
1 This is the vision that Isaiah, son of Amoz, had about Judah and Jerusalem during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah.

2 Listen, skies, and pay attention, earth: God has spoken, I have raised and cared for children, but they have turned against me.

3 The ox knows its owner, and the donkey knows where its master feeds it, but Israel doesn't know, my people don't think about it.

4 Oh sinful country, people full of wrongdoing, offspring of those who do evil, kids who spoil things: they have left God, they have made the Holy One of Israel angry, they have turned away.

5 Why should you be punished again? You will only rebel more and more: your entire mind is ill, and your entire heart is weak.

6 From the bottom of the foot to the top of the head, there is no health in it; only wounds, bruises, and open sores. They have not been cleaned, bandaged, or treated with ointment.

7 Your country is empty, your cities are burned: strangers eat up your land in front of you, and it is empty, as destroyed by outsiders.

8 The Daughter of Zion is left like a small house in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a city surrounded by enemies.

9 If God had not left us a small group of survivors, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been like Gomorrah.

10 Listen to God's message, you leaders of Sodom; pay attention to our God's rules, people of Gomorrah.

11 Why do you offer me so many sacrifices? says God. I have had enough of burnt rams and fat from well-fed animals; I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats.

12 When you come to meet me, who asked you to walk in my courtyards?

13 Stop bringing worthless gifts; I hate the smell of incense. New moon celebrations, Sabbaths, and meetingsâ€”I cannot stand them; they are full of sin, even the special gatherings.

14 I hate your new moons and celebrations; they bother me, and I am tired of putting up with them.

15 When you raise your hands, I will look away from you; even when you pray a lot, I won't listen: your hands have blood on them.

16 Clean yourselves, make yourselves pure; stop doing wrong things that I see; stop doing bad things.

17 Learn to do good; seek fairness, help those who are suffering, defend orphans, and argue for widows.

18 Come now, and let's talk this over, says God: even if your sins are bright red, they will become as white as snow; even if they are deep red like crimson, they will be like wool.

19 If you are willing and obey, you will enjoy the best from the land.

20 If you refuse and rebel, you will be destroyed by the sword because God has said it.

21 How has the loyal city turned into a prostitute! It was once full of fairness; goodness made its home there; but now there are killers.

22 Your silver has turned to waste, your wine diluted with water.

23 Your leaders are disobedient and friends with thieves: they all love getting gifts and chase after rewards: they do not defend orphans, nor do they care about the needs of widows.

24 So God, the powerful One of Israel, says, "I will get relief from my foes and take revenge on my enemies."

25 I will intervene for you, completely remove your impurities, and get rid of all your lesser metals.

26 I will bring back your judges like before, and your advisors as in the start; then you will be known as the city of rightness, the loyal city.

27 Zion will be saved through justice, and those who turn to her will be brought back with fairness.

28 The ruin of wrongdoers and sinners will happen at the same time, and those who abandon God will be destroyed.

29 They will feel shame for the oak trees you wanted, and you will be embarrassed about the gardens you picked.

30 You will be like an oak tree with withering leaves, and like a garden without water.

31 The strong will be like tinder, and their creator like a spark; they will both burn, and no one will put them out.
