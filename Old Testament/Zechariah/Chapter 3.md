1 He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before God's angel, and Satan standing at his right side to oppose him.

2 God said to Satan, "God corrects you, Satan; God who chose Jerusalem corrects you. Isn't this like a stick saved from the fire?"

3 Joshua was wearing dirty clothes and stood in front of the angel.

4 He replied to those standing before him, "Remove the dirty clothes from him." Then he said to him, "See, I have taken away your sin, and I will dress you in new clothes."

5 I said, "Put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and gave him clothes to wear. And God's messenger stood by.

6 The angel of God warned Joshua, saying,

7 God says: If you follow my ways and keep my commands, then you will also govern my house and guard my courts, and I will give you places to walk among those who stand here.

8 Listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit with you: they are men to be marveled at. Look, I will bring out my servant, the Branch.

9 Look at the stone I put in front of Joshua. This one stone has seven eyes on it. I will carve its design, says God, and in one day, I will take away the sin of that land.

10 On that day, says God, everyone will invite their neighbor to sit together under the vine and the fig tree.
