1 On that day, there will be a spring made available to David's family and to the people of Jerusalem for cleansing from sin and impurity.

2 On that day, God says, I will remove the idols from the land, and they will be forgotten. I will also get rid of the false prophets and evil spirits from the land.

3 When someone still claims to speak for God, his own parents will say, "You must not live because you tell lies in God's name." They will be the ones to end his life for doing so.

4 On that day, the prophets will feel shame for every vision when they have prophesied; they won't wear rough clothes to trick people.

5 But he will say, "I am not a prophet, I am a farmer; a person taught me to care for animals since I was young."

6 Someone will ask him, "What are these wounds on your hands?" And he will reply, "These are the wounds I got at my friends' house."

7 Wake up, sword, against my shepherd, and against the man close to me, says God. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will run away; I will act against the small ones.

8 God says that in the whole land, two-thirds will be cut off and die, but one-third will be left.

9 I will take a third of the people through fire and make them pure like silver, and test them like gold. They will call on me, and I will listen. I will say, 'These are my people,' and they will say, 'God is our God.'
