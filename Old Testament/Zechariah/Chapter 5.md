1 Then I turned, raised my eyes, and saw a flying scroll.

2 He asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a flying scroll; it is twenty units long and ten units wide."

3 He told me, "This is the curse that will spread across the whole earth: everyone who steals will be punished as shown here; and everyone who lies under oath will be punished as shown there."

4 I will make this happen, says God of all, and it will go into the thief's house, and into the house of anyone who lies using my name: it will stay in the middle of his house, and destroy it, with its wood and stones.

5 The angel who was speaking to me went out and then said to me, "Look up now and see what is coming out."

6 I asked, "What is that?" He replied, "This is a measuring basket that is being sent out." He also said, "This represents them throughout the whole world."

7 Then I saw a piece of lead lifted up, and there was a woman sitting inside the basket.

8 He said, "This is evil." He threw it into the ephah and put the lead cover over its opening.

9 I looked up and saw two women coming with the wind in their wings. They had wings like a stork's wings. They lifted the basket up into the sky, between the earth and heaven.

10 Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the basket?"

11 He told me to build a house for it in the land of Shinar: it will be set up and stand on its own foundation.
