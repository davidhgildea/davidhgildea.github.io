1 The angel who was speaking with me came back and woke me up like someone being woken from sleep.

2 He asked me, "What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a golden lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lights on it, with seven tubes going to the lights."

3 Two olive trees were next to it, one on the right side of the bowl and one on the left side.

4 So I replied to the angel speaking with me, asking, "What are these, sir?"

5 The angel speaking with me replied and asked, "Do you not know what these are?" And I answered, "No, sir."

6 He replied to me, "This is what God tells Zerubbabel: 'Not by strength or by force, but by my spirit,' says God."

7 Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel, you will become flat land: and he will present the top stone amid shouts of 'Grace, grace to it!'

8 Also, God spoke to me, saying,

9 Zerubbabel's hands have started building this house; his hands will also complete it; and you will know that God has sent me to you.

10 Who has looked down on small beginnings? They will celebrate and see the measuring line in Zerubbabel's hand along with the seven; they represent God's eyes, which move throughout the entire world.

11 I answered and asked him, "What are these two olive trees on the right and left sides of the lampstand?"

12 I replied again and asked him, "What are these two olive branches that pour out golden oil through the two gold pipes?"

13 He answered and asked, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, sir."

14 He said, "These are the two chosen ones who stand by God of the whole earth."
