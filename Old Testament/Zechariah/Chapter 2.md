1 I looked up once more, and saw a man holding a measuring tape.

2 Then I asked, "Where are you going?" And he answered me, "To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is."

3 The angel who was speaking with me left, and another angel came out to meet him.

4 He said to him, "Go quickly, tell the young man, 'Jerusalem will be filled with people and animals, and it won't need walls.'"

5 I, says God, will be like a protective wall of fire around her, and I will be the honor within her.

6 Come, come, leave the land of the north, says God, for I have scattered you in all directions like the four winds of the sky, says God.

7 Save yourself, Zion, who lives among the people of Babylon.

8 God, the Lord of all, says this: After the glory, he sent me to the nations that robbed you. Because whoever harms you, harms the apple of his eye.

9 Look, I will wave my hand at them, and they will become loot for their own slaves. Then you will know that God has sent me.

10 Sing and be happy, daughter of Zion; for look, I am coming and I will live among you, says God.

11 Many countries will join with God on that day and will be my people. I will live among you, and you will realize that God has sent me to you.

12 God will take Judah as his own in the sacred land and will choose Jerusalem once more.

13 Everyone be quiet before God, for he has risen from his sacred home.
