1 About the times and dates, friends, you don't need me to write to you.

2 You know very well that the day of God will come like a thief in the night.

3 When people say, "Peace and safety," then sudden ruin will hit them, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they won't escape.

4 But friends, you are not in the dark, so that the day should surprise you like a thief.

5 You are all children of light and of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness.

6 So let's not sleep like others; instead, let's stay alert and clear-headed.

7 People who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.

8 Let us who live in the light be clear-minded, wearing faith and love as a protective vest, and the hope of being saved as a helmet.

9 God has not chosen us for anger, but to gain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.

10 He died for us so that, awake or asleep, we might live with him.

11 Encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.

12 We ask you, friends, to recognize those who work hard among you, who guide you in the Lord, and who warn you.

13 Value them greatly with love because of their work and live peacefully with each other.

14 We urge you, friends, to warn those who are not following the rules, encourage those who are discouraged, help those who are weak, and be patient with everyone.

15 Make sure no one pays back wrong for wrong to anyone; but always try to do what is good, for each other and for everyone else.

16 Be happy always.

17 Keep praying all the time.

18 In everything, be thankful: because this is what God wants for you in Christ Jesus.

19 Do not put out the Spirit's fire.

20 Do not look down on prophecies.

21 Test everything; keep what is good.

22 Stay away from anything that looks evil.

23 May the God of peace make you completely holy, and I hope God keeps your spirit, soul, and body without fault until our Lord Jesus Christ comes.

24 God, who calls you, is faithful and will do what he promises.

25 Brothers and sisters, pray for us.

26 Say hello to all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.

27 I ask you seriously in God's name to make sure this letter is read to all the believers.

28 May the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
