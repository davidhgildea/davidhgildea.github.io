1 So when we couldn't wait any longer, we decided to stay alone in Athens.

2 We sent Timothy, our brother, who serves God and works with us to spread the good news about Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith.

3 No one should be upset by these troubles, because you know we are meant to go through them.

4 Truly, when we were with you, we warned you that we would face troubles; and it happened, just as you know.

5 Because I couldn't wait any longer, I sent to ask about your faith, in case the tempter had tempted you and our work would be useless.

6 But now Timothy has come to us from you and told us about your faith and love. He said you always remember us well and really want to see us, just as we want to see you.

7 So, friends, your faith made us feel better, even with all our troubles and hardships.

8 We live fully if you remain strong in faith.

9 How can we thank God enough for you, for all the happiness we feel because of you in the presence of God?

10 Day and night we pray deeply to see you and to strengthen what is missing in your faith.

11 May God himself, our Father, and Jesus Christ, our Lord, guide us to you.

12 May God help you grow and overflow with love for each other and for everyone, just as we do for you.

13 So that God may make your hearts strong and pure in the sight of God, our Father, when our Lord Jesus Christ comes with all his holy people.
