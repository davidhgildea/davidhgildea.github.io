1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the Thessalonian church in God and Jesus Christ: may you have grace and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ.

2 We always thank God for all of you, remembering you in our prayers.

3 We constantly remember your faith in action, love's hard work, and hopeful patience in our Lord Jesus Christ, before God our Father.

4 Dear friends, know that God has chosen you.

5 Our good news didn't come to you just by words, but also with power, God's Spirit, and strong confidence; as you know how we acted among you for your benefit.

6 You followed our example and God's, accepting the message in great trouble yet with Holy Spirit's joy.

7 So you became examples to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.

8 From you, the message of God has spread not only in Macedonia and Achaia but also everywhere your faith in God is known; so we don't need to say anything more.

9 People tell how we came to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the true and living God.

10 To wait for his Son from heaven, whom God raised from the dead, Jesus who saves us from the coming anger.
