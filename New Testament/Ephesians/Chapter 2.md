1 God made you alive even when you were dead because of your wrong actions and sins.

2 Before, you lived as the world does, following the ruler of the earthly realm, the spirit that is active in those who disobey.

3 We all once lived following our human desires, doing what our bodies and minds wanted. By nature, we were destined to face anger just like everyone else.

4 God, rich in mercy, because of his great love for us,

5 Even when we were dead in our wrongdoings, God made us alive with Christ, (because of kindness you are saved).

6 God raised us up with Christ and seated us together in heaven with Jesus.

7 In future times, he could show us the great wealth of his kindness through Jesus Christ.

8 You are saved by God's kindness through faith. This is not from yourselves; it's God's gift.

9 Not from what we do, so no one can brag.

10 We are what God has made us, created in Jesus to do good things, which God planned for us to do.

11 Remember that you were once non-Jews in the body, called 'Uncircumcised' by those called 'Circumcised,' which is done in the body by hand.

12 At that time, you were without Christ, outsiders to Israel's citizenship, unfamiliar with the promises' agreements, without hope, and without God in the world.

13 Now in Christ Jesus, you who were once far away have been brought close by Christ's blood.

14 He is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall between us.

15 He ended the hostility with his own body, by ending the law with its rules. This was to create in himself one new humanity from two, making peace.

16 He aimed to bring both together in one body to God through the cross, by putting an end to their hostility that way.

17 He came and told you far away and those close about peace.

18 Through him, we both reach the Father by one Spirit.

19 So now you are not strangers or outsiders, but you are citizens together with God's people and members of God's family.

20 You are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ as the most important cornerstone.

21 Everyone in the building is joined together and grows into a holy temple for God.

22 In whom you also are built together to be a home for God by the Spirit.
