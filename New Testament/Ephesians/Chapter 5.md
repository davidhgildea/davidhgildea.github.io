1 So be like God, as beloved children.

2 Live in love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself for us, as a gift and sacrifice to God that is like a pleasing aroma.

3 Avoid sexual immorality, all impurity, or greed; don't even mention these things among you, as is proper for God's holy people.

4 Avoid dirty talk, silly words, or jokes that are not appropriate, but instead, give thanks.

5 You know that no one who sleeps around, is unclean, or is greedy—which is worshiping wealth—has a place in Christ and God's kingdom.

6 Do not let anyone trick you with empty words, because God's anger comes on those who disobey because of these things.

7 So do not join in with them.

8 You were once in darkness, but now you are in the light with God: live as children of light.

9 The Spirit's fruit is goodness, righteousness, and truth.

10 Showing what pleases God.

11 Do not join in the useless deeds of darkness, but instead correct them.

12 It is embarrassing even to talk about the things they do secretly.

13 Everything that is shown to be wrong is revealed by the light, because anything that reveals is light.

14 So he says, "Wake up, sleeper, get up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."

15 Make sure you live carefully, not like foolish people, but like wise ones.

16 Use time wisely, because these are bad days.

17 So don't be foolish, but understand what God wants.

18 Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to bad behavior; instead, be filled with the Spirit.

19 Talk to each other with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, sing and make music in your heart to God.

20 Always give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

21 Respect each other because you respect God.

22 Wives, follow your own husbands, just as you do God.

23 The husband is the leader of the wife, just as Christ is the leader of the church; and he is the one who saves it.

24 So as the church obeys Christ, wives should also obey their husbands in everything.

25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the people of the church and gave himself up for them.

26 So he could make it holy and clean it by washing it with water and with the word.

27 He wanted to make the church glorious for himself, without any spots, wrinkles, or anything like that; it should be holy and perfect.

28 Men should love their wives as they love their own bodies. Someone who loves his wife loves himself.

29 No one ever hates their own body; instead, they feed and care for it, just like God does for the church.

30 We are parts of his body, his flesh, and his bones.

31 For this reason, a man will leave his parents and unite with his wife, and they will become one body.

32 This is a big mystery, but I am talking about Christ and the church.

33 Each of you should love your wife as yourself, and every wife should respect her husband.
