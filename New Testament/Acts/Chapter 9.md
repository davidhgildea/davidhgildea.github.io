1 Saul, still making threats and wanting to kill the followers of the Lord, went to the high priest.

2 He asked for letters to the Damascus places of worship, so that if he found anyone who followed this path, man or woman, he could take them tied up to Jerusalem.

3 As he traveled, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.

4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"

5 He asked, "Who are you, God?" And God replied, "I am Jesus, the one you are hurting. It's tough for you to fight against what's urging you."

6 He, shaking and amazed, said, "God, what do you want me to do?" God told him, "Get up, go into the city, and you will be told what you need to do."

7 The men traveling with him stood silently, hearing a voice but seeing no one.

8 Saul got up from the ground; when he opened his eyes, he couldn't see anyone. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.

9 He could not see for three days and did not eat or drink.

10 In Damascus there was a follower named Ananias. In a vision God called to him, "Ananias." He answered, "Here I am, God."

11 God told him, "Get up, go to the street named Straight, and ask at Judas' house for a man named Saul from Tarsus because he is praying."

12 In a vision, he saw a man named Ananias come in and touch him so he could see again.

13 Then Ananias answered, "God, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem."

14 He has permission from the high priests to arrest everyone who prays to you.

15 But God said to him, "Go on your way, because he is my chosen tool to bring my name to non-Jews, rulers, and the people of Israel."

16 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.

17 Ananias went to the house, put his hands on Saul, and said, "Brother Saul, Jesus, who you saw on your way here, sent me so you can see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit."

18 Right away, something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see. Then he got up and was baptized.

19 After he ate food, he gained strength. Then Saul spent some days with the followers in Damascus.

20 Right away, he told people in the synagogues that Jesus is God's Son.

21 Everyone who heard him was amazed and asked, "Isn't this the man who was destroying those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and didn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the priests?"

22 Saul grew stronger and confused the Jews living in Damascus by showing that Jesus is truly the Christ.

23 After many days, the Jews planned to kill him.

24 Saul knew they were waiting to ambush him. They guarded the city gates day and night to kill him.

25 The followers took him at night and lowered him down the city wall in a basket.

26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to meet with the followers, but they were all scared of him and didn't believe he was really a follower.

27 Barnabas took him to the apostles and told them how he saw Jesus on his journey, that Jesus spoke to him, and how he bravely preached in Jesus' name in Damascus.

28 He was with them when they entered and left Jerusalem.

29 He spoke bravely in the name of Jesus and argued with the Greeks, but they tried to kill him.

30 When the followers learned this, they took him to Caesarea and sent him on to Tarsus.

31 The churches in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace, grew stronger, lived in respect for God, and, encouraged by the Holy Spirit, increased in number.

32 As Peter traveled through different places, he also visited the holy people living in Lydda.

33 There he met a man named Aeneas who had been bedridden for eight years because he was paralyzed.

34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you: get up and prepare your bed." And he got up at once.

35 Everyone living in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to God.

36 In Joppa, there was a follower named Tabitha, also known as Dorcas, who did many good deeds and helped the poor.

37 In those days, she became ill and died. After they washed her body, they placed her in an upstairs room.

38 Because Lydda was close to Joppa and the followers knew Peter was there, they sent two men to ask him to come quickly.

39 Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him to the upstairs room where all the widows were crying and showing him the clothes and robes Dorcas had made while she was alive.

40 Peter sent everyone out, knelt down, and prayed. Then he turned to the body and said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

41 He took her hand, helped her stand, and after calling the believers and widows, showed her to them alive.

42 News spread all over Joppa; many people believed in God.

43 He stayed in Joppa for many days with a man named Simon, who was a leather worker.
