1 While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the inland areas and arrived in Ephesus, where he met some disciples.

2 He asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit after you believed?" They replied, "We haven't even heard if there is a Holy Spirit."

3 He asked them, "Then what baptism did you receive?" They replied, "John's baptism."

4 Paul said, John truly baptized with a baptism to show repentance, telling the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.

5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of Jesus.

6 When Paul put his hands on them, God's Spirit came upon them; they spoke in different languages and gave God's messages.

7 There were about twelve men in total.

8 He went to the meeting place and spoke confidently for three months, discussing and convincing people about God's kingdom.

9 But when some people became stubborn and did not believe, and talked badly about the faith in front of many, he left them, took the believers aside, and discussed with them every day in the school of Tyrannus.

10 This went on for two years, so that everyone living in Asia heard the message of Lord Jesus, including Jews and Greeks.

11 God did amazing miracles through Paul.

12 People took cloths and aprons from his body to the ill, and their sicknesses left them, and the bad spirits came out.

13 Some wandering Jewish people who cast out demons tried to use the name of Jesus that Paul talks about, saying to the evil spirits, "We command you by Jesus to come out."

14 There were seven sons of a Jewish man named Sceva, a high priest, who did the same.

15 The evil spirit spoke back, "I know Jesus and I know Paul; but who are you?"

16 The man with the evil spirit jumped on them, beat them, and was too strong for them, so they ran away from the house naked and hurt.

17 Everyone in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, learned about this; they all became afraid, and they praised the name of Jesus greatly.

18 Many who believed came, admitted their actions, and showed what they had done.

19 Many people who practiced magic collected their books and burned them in front of everyone. They added up the value of the books and it was fifty thousand silver coins.

20 God's message spread powerfully and won.

21 After finishing these tasks, Paul decided to travel through Macedonia and Achaia and then go to Jerusalem. He said, "After visiting there, I must go to Rome too."

22 So he sent two helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in Asia for a while.

23 At that time, there was quite a commotion about that way.

24 A man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver temples for Diana, earned a lot of money for the craftsmen.

25 He gathered the craftsmen of the same trade and said, "Friends, you know that we earn our living from this skill."

26 You see and hear that not only in Ephesus but also across Asia, this Paul has convinced and led many people away by saying that handmade things are not gods.

27 So, our work is at risk of being ignored; and the temple of the great goddess Diana may be looked down on, and her grandness ruined, which all Asia and the world worships.

28 When they heard this, they became very angry and started shouting, "Diana of the Ephesians is great!"

29 The whole city was confused, and they grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians and Paul's travel friends, and all together they ran to the theater.

30 When Paul wanted to meet with the people, the disciples did not allow him.

31 Some of the Asian leaders who were his friends sent him a message, asking him not to risk going into the theater.

32 So some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another. The group was mixed up, and most didn't know why they had gathered.

33 They pulled Alexander from the crowd, the Jews pushing him to the front. Alexander waved his hand, wanting to explain himself to the people.

34 When they realized he was a Jew, everyone shouted together for about two hours, "Diana of the Ephesians is great!"

35 When the city clerk made the crowd quiet, he said, "People of Ephesus, everyone knows that our city worships the great goddess Diana and the statue that came down from the god Jupiter."

36 Since these facts are undeniable, you should stay calm and not act hastily.

37 You have brought these men here who have not stolen from churches or spoken against your goddess.

38 If Demetrius and the other workers have a complaint against someone, they can go to court, where the officials are: they should argue their case there.

39 If you ask about other issues, a legal meeting will decide them.

40 We are at risk of being questioned about today's chaos, as there is no reason to explain this crowd.

41 After saying this, he sent the people away.
