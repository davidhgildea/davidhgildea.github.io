1 In Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a captain of the Italian group.

2 A religious man who respected God with his whole family, gave lots of charity to others, and always prayed to God.

3 In a clear vision around three in the afternoon, he saw an angel of God come to him and say, "Cornelius."

4 When he saw him, he was scared and asked, "What is it, God?" And God answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have been remembered by God."

5 Now, send people to Joppa and ask for a man named Simon, also known as Peter.

6 He is staying with Simon, a leather worker, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you should do.

7 After the angel who spoke to Cornelius left, he summoned two of his servants and a loyal soldier who served him regularly.

8 After he explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.

9 The next day, as they were traveling and getting close to the city, Peter went up to the rooftop to pray around noon.

10 He became very hungry and wanted to eat, but as they were preparing the food, he fell into a deep dream.

11 He saw heaven open and a vessel coming down to him, like a large sheet tied at the four corners, being lowered to the ground.

12 In it were all kinds of four-legged animals, wild creatures, crawling things, and birds of the sky.

13 A voice came to him saying, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat."

14 Peter said, "No, God; I have never eaten anything not pure or clean."

15 The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."

16 This happened three times, and then the container was taken back up into heaven.

17 While Peter was wondering what his vision meant, the men Cornelius sent asked for Simon's house and were standing at the gate.

18 They called and asked if Simon, also known as Peter, was staying there.

19 As Peter was thinking about the vision, the Spirit told him, "Look, three men are looking for you."

20 Get up, go down, and go with them without doubting, because I have sent them.

21 Then Peter went to the men who Cornelius sent to him and said, "Look, I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?"

22 They said, "Cornelius, a fair officer, who respects God and is well spoken of by all the Jewish people, was told by God through a holy angel to invite you to his home and listen to what you have to say."

23 He invited them in to stay. The next day Peter left with them, and some believers from Joppa went along.

24 The next day they arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had gathered his relatives and close friends.

25 As Peter entered, Cornelius met him, knelt before him, and honored him as if he were God.

26 Peter helped him up, saying, "Get up; I am just a man like you."

27 As he chatted with him, he entered and saw many people had gathered.

28 He told them, "You are aware that it's not allowed for a Jewish man to associate with or visit someone from a different nation. However, God has shown me that I should not consider any person impure or unclean."

29 So I came to you without arguing, as soon as I was called. Why did you call for me?

30 Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this time. At three in the afternoon, I was praying in my home, when suddenly a man in shining clothes stood in front of me.

31 Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your acts of charity are remembered before God.

32 Go to Joppa and ask for Simon, also known as Peter, who is staying at the home of Simon the leatherworker by the sea. When he arrives, he will talk to you.

33 I sent for you right away; you did right to come. Now we're all here before God to listen to everything God has told you to tell us.

34 Then Peter began to speak, "I truly understand that God does not show favoritism to anyone.

35 In every country, anyone who respects God and does what is right is accepted by Him.

36 God sent a message to the people of Israel, telling them about peace through Jesus Christ: (he is the ruler of all.)

37 You know the message that spread through all Judea, starting in Galilee after the baptism John preached.

38 God gave Jesus of Nazareth the Holy Spirit and power. He went around doing good and healing all who were under the devil's control, because God was with him.

39 We saw everything he did in the Jewish lands and in Jerusalem. They killed him and hung him on a tree.

40 God raised him up on the third day and showed him openly.

41 Not to everyone, but to chosen witnesses before God, to us who ate and drank with him after he came back to life.

42 He told us to speak to the people and to say that he is the one chosen by God to judge the living and the dead.

43 Every prophet agrees that anyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his name.

44 While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit came upon all who heard the message.

45 The believers who were Jews were amazed because the Holy Spirit was given to the non-Jewish people who had come with Peter.

46 They heard them speaking in different languages and praising God. Then Peter replied.

47 Can anyone stop these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just like us.

48 He ordered them to be baptized in God's name. Then they asked him to stay for some days.
