1 After they were safe, they learned that the island's name was Melita.

2 The local people were very kind to us. They made a fire and welcomed all of us because it was raining and cold.

3 When Paul collected some sticks and put them on the fire, a snake came out from the warmth and bit his hand.

4 When the local people saw the poisonous snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, "Surely this man is a killer. Even though he survived the sea, justice will not let him live."

5 He threw the snake into the fire and was not hurt.

6 They expected him to swell up or suddenly drop dead, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.

7 In that area, the island's leader, named Publius, owned land. He welcomed us and kindly let us stay for three days.

8 Publius's father was sick with a fever and severe diarrhea. Paul went to him, prayed, put his hands on him, and healed him.

9 After this happened, more people on the island who were sick came and were healed.

10 They also showed us much respect and gave us what we needed when we left.

11 After three months, we left on a ship from Alexandria that had spent the winter on the island, marked with the symbols Castor and Pollux.

12 We landed at Syracuse and stayed there for three days.

13 From there we circled around and reached Rhegium. After one day, a south wind started blowing, and the next day we arrived at Puteoli.

14 We met fellow believers who asked us to stay with them for seven days; then we continued on to Rome.

15 From there, when the believers heard about us, they came to meet us all the way to the Market of Appius and the Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and felt encouraged.

16 When we arrived in Rome, the centurion handed the prisoners over to the guard's commander, but Paul was allowed to live alone with a soldier guarding him.

17 After three days, Paul gathered the Jewish leaders. Once they assembled, he told them, "Friends, although I did nothing against our people or our ancestors' ways, I was still handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem to the Romans."

18 After they questioned me, they wanted to release me because they found no reason to kill me.

19 But when the Jews spoke against me, I had to ask for Caesar's judgment; not because I had any charges against my people.

20 I called for you so I could see and talk with you, because I am chained up due to the hope of Israel.

21 They told him, "We haven't gotten any letters from Judea about you, and none of our friends who have come here have spoken or said anything bad about you."

22 We want to hear what you think, because people everywhere speak against this group.

23 When they set a day, many came to his place. He explained the kingdom of God to them, convincing them about Jesus using the laws of Moses and the prophets, all day long.

24 Some believed what was said, and some did not believe.

25 When they could not agree, they left after Paul said, "The Holy Spirit was right to speak to our ancestors through the prophet Isaiah."

26 Go to these people and tell them, "Though you listen, you will not understand; though you look, you will not really see."

27 The hearts of these people have become hard, their ears are hard to hear, and they have shut their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, turn to me, and be healed by me.

28 Know this: God's salvation is sent to the non-Jews, and they will listen to it.

29 After he said this, the Jews left and had intense discussions with each other.

30 Paul lived for two full years in a house he rented, and he welcomed everyone who visited him.

31 Teaching about God's kingdom and explaining things about the Lord Jesus Christ with full confidence, and no one stopping him.
