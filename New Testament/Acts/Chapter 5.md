1 A man named Ananias and his wife Sapphira sold something they owned.

2 He held back some of the money, his wife knew about it, and he gave part of it and put it at the apostles' feet.

3 Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan made you lie to the Holy Spirit and hold back some of the money from the land?

4 Before you sold it, wasn't it yours? And after you sold it, wasn't the money yours to control? Why did you decide to do this? You haven't lied to people but to God.

5 Ananias heard these words, fell down, and died. Everyone who heard about it was very afraid.

6 The young men got up, wrapped him up, took him out, and buried him.

7 About three hours later, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.

8 Peter asked her, "Did you sell the land for this amount?" And she replied, "Yes, for that amount."

9 Then Peter said to her, "Why did you both decide to test the Spirit of God? Look, the ones who buried your husband are at the door, and they will take you out too."

10 She immediately fell down at his feet, died, and when the young men came in, they found her dead, carried her out, and buried her beside her husband.

11 Everyone in the church and all who heard about these events were filled with great fear.

12 Through the apostles, many miracles and amazing things happened among the people; they were all together in Solomon's Porch.

13 No one else dared to join them, but the people praised them.

14 More believers, both men and women, were added to God in large numbers.

15 They brought the sick into the streets and placed them on beds and mats so that even Peter's shadow might fall on some as he walked by.

16 Many people came from nearby towns to Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those troubled by evil spirits, and all of them were healed.

17 The high priest stood up, and everyone with him, who were the Sadducees group, were very angry.

18 They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.

19 At night, God's angel opened the prison doors, took them out, and said.

20 Go, stand in the temple, and tell the people everything about this life.

21 When they heard that, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught. The high priest and his group gathered the council and the whole Israeli senate and sent for the prisoners to be brought.

22 When the guards arrived and didn't find them in jail, they went back and reported it.

23 We found the jail securely locked and the guards standing outside the doors, but when we opened it, there was no one inside.

24 When the high priest, the temple captain, and the chief priests heard all this, they were unsure what it would lead to.

25 Someone came and said, "Look, the men you put in jail are in the temple, teaching the people."

26 The captain and his men went and brought them back without using force, because they were afraid the people might throw stones at them.

27 When they brought them in, they stood before the leaders, and the chief priest questioned them.

28 We clearly ordered you not to teach in this name, yet you have spread your teaching all over Jerusalem and want to make us responsible for this man's death.

29 Peter and the other apostles replied, "We must obey God instead of people."

30 God of our ancestors brought Jesus back to life, who you killed and hung on a tree.

31 God has raised him up with his right hand to be a leader and a savior, to give Israel a chance to change their ways and to forgive their sins.

32 We are his witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit, which God has given to those who obey him, is also a witness.

33 When they heard that, they felt deeply hurt and planned to kill them.

34 A Pharisee named Gamaliel, a respected teacher of the law, stood up in the council and ordered that the apostles be taken outside for a short time.

35 He told them, "People of Israel, be careful about what you plan to do to these men."

36 Before this time, Theudas appeared, claiming to be important. About four hundred men joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were scattered and came to nothing.

37 After him, Judas from Galilee appeared during the tax times and attracted many followers. He died too, and all who followed him were scattered.

38 I tell you now, stay away from these men and leave them be; because if their plan or action is from people, it will fail.

39 But if it's from God, you can't defeat it; you might be found fighting against God.

40 They agreed with him. After calling the apostles and whipping them, they ordered them not to talk about Jesus and then released them.

41 They left the council, happy because they were considered deserving to endure shame for his name.

42 Every day in the temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and telling the good news about Jesus Christ.
