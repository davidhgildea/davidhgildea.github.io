1 In the Antioch church, there were some prophets and teachers like Barnabas, Simeon also known as Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen who grew up with Herod the ruler, and Saul.

2 While they served God and went without food, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart Barnabas and Saul for the job I have chosen them for."

3 After they fasted, prayed, and put their hands on them, they sent them off.

4 They were sent by the Holy Spirit and went to Seleucia; from there they sailed to Cyprus.

5 When they were in Salamis, they shared God's message in the Jewish synagogues and John helped them.

6 After they traveled across the island to Paphos, they met a magician who was a fake prophet and a Jew named Barjesus.

7 He was with the governor of the region, Sergius Paulus, a wise man. He asked for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear God's message.

8 Elymas the magician tried to stop them and wanted to keep the governor from believing.

9 Then Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at him.

10 And said, "Oh, you are very tricky and evil, you child of the devil and enemy of everything good, will you not stop twisting the true paths of God?"

11 Now, look, God's power is on you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a while. Suddenly, he was covered in a fog and darkness, and he walked around looking for someone to guide him by the hand.

12 When the governor saw what happened, he believed and was amazed at God's teaching.

13 When Paul and his friends sailed from Paphos, they arrived at Perga in Pamphylia. John left them and went back to Jerusalem.

14 After leaving Perga, they arrived in Antioch in Pisidia, entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and sat down.

15 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the synagogue leaders sent a message to them, saying, "Friends, if you have any encouraging message for the people, please speak."

16 Paul stood up, waved his hand, and said, "People of Israel and all who respect God, listen to me."

17 God chose our ancestors, honored the people while they lived as foreigners in Egypt, and with great power led them out of there.

18 For forty years God put up with their behavior in the desert.

19 After he defeated seven nations in Canaan, he gave their land to them by drawing lots.

20 After that, he gave them leaders for about 450 years, until Samuel the prophet.

21 Later they wanted a king, so God gave them Saul, son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.

22 After removing him, God made David their king and testified about him, saying, "I have found David, Jesse's son, a man who shares my desires and will do everything I want."

23 God promised to bring Israel a Savior, Jesus, from this man's descendants.

24 Before Jesus came, John told all the people of Israel to turn away from their sins and be baptized.

25 As John finished his work, he asked, "Who do you think I am? I am not the one. But look, someone is coming after me, and I'm not good enough to untie his sandals."

26 Friends and descendants of Abraham, and all who honor God, this message of salvation is for you.

27 The people living in Jerusalem and their leaders didn't recognize him or understand what the prophets said, even though they read their words every Sabbath. By condemning him, they made these prophecies come true.

28 Even though they could not prove he deserved to die, they still asked Pilate to have him killed.

29 After completing all that was written about him, they removed him from the cross and placed him in a tomb.

30 God raised him from the dead.

31 He was seen for many days by those who went with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who now tell the people about him.

32 We share with you good news about the promise given to our ancestors.

33 God has done what he promised our ancestors by raising Jesus from the dead, as it's written in the second psalm: "You are my Son; today I have become your father."

34 About raising him from the dead, never to decay again, he said, I will give you the faithful blessings promised to David.

35 That's why it is said in another psalm, "You will not let your Holy One decay."

36 David served his time by God's will, then he died, was buried with his ancestors, and his body decayed.

37 But he, who was raised by God, did not decay.

38 Let it be clear to you then, friends, that through this man the forgiveness of sins is announced to you.

39 By him, all who believe are made right with God from everything that the law of Moses could not make right.

40 Be careful, so what the prophets said doesn't happen to you.

41 Look, you who scoff, be amazed and vanish: because I am doing something in your days, something you will never believe, even if someone explains it to you.

42 After the Jews left the synagogue, the non-Jews asked to hear these teachings the following Sabbath.

43 After the meeting ended, many Jews and believers followed Paul and Barnabas. They talked to them and encouraged them to keep living in God's kindness.

44 On the next Sabbath, nearly the whole city gathered to hear God's message.

45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they felt jealous and spoke against what Paul was saying, arguing and insulting God.

46 Paul and Barnabas became brave and said, "It was important to speak God's word to you first. But since you reject it and think you're not worthy of eternal life, now we will speak to other people."

47 God has instructed us, saying, I have made you a light for the non-Jews, so that you may bring salvation to the farthest places of the world.

48 When the non-Jews heard this, they were happy and praised God's message. All those chosen for eternal life believed.

49 God's message spread all over the area.

50 The Jews convinced the religious and respected women and the city's leaders to persecute Paul and Barnabas and forced them to leave their region.

51 They brushed the dust from their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium.

52 The followers were filled with happiness and the Holy Spirit.
