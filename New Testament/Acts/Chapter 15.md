1 Some men from Judaea came and told the believers, "You must be circumcised like Moses taught, or you cannot be saved."

2 So when Paul and Barnabas had a big argument with some people, they decided that Paul, Barnabas, and a few others should go to Jerusalem to talk to the apostles and elders about this matter.

3 The church helped them on their journey, and they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling how the non-Jews had turned to God, which brought great happiness to all the believers.

4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, the church, the apostles, and the elders welcomed them, and they shared everything God had done with them.

5 Some Pharisees who believed stood up and said that it was necessary to circumcise the men and to tell them to follow the Law of Moses.

6 The apostles and leaders met to discuss this issue.

7 After much discussion, Peter stood up and said to them, "Friends, you know that some time ago God chose me so that the non-Jews could hear the message of the good news from me and believe.

8 God, who knows the hearts, showed approval of them by giving the Holy Spirit, just as God did to us.

9 God made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts through faith.

10 So why are you testing God by putting a heavy burden on the followers' necks that neither our ancestors nor we could carry?

11 We believe that by the kindness of Jesus Christ, we will be saved just like them.

12 Everyone was quiet and listened to Barnabas and Paul as they explained the amazing things God had done through them among the non-Jews.

13 After they were quiet, James spoke, saying, "Listen to me, friends and brothers:

14 Simeon has explained how God first visited the non-Jews to choose some of them to be his people.

15 The prophets' words agree with this; it is written,

16 I will come back and rebuild David's fallen shelter; I will repair its ruins and restore it.

17 So that the rest of people might look for God, and all the non-Jews who are called by my name, says God, who does all these things.

18 God knows all his works since the world began.

19 So I decide that we should not bother the Gentiles who turn to God.

20 We should write to them to stay away from idol pollution, sexual immorality, strangled animals, and blood.

21 Since long ago, Moses has had people in every city who teach about him; his writings are read in the synagogues every Sabbath.

22 The apostles, elders, and the whole church agreed to send some of their own men to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas, also known as Barsabas, and Silas, who were leaders among the believers.

23 The apostles, elders, and fellow believers send greetings to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.

24 We've heard some who left us have upset you with their words, turning your hearts away, telling you to be circumcised and follow the law, which we did not tell them to do.

25 We agreed together to send some chosen friends to you along with our dear Barnabas and Paul.

26 Men who risked their lives for Jesus Christ.

27 We have sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same things in person.

28 The Holy Spirit and we have decided not to give you any heavy burdens besides these important things.

29 Avoid eating food given to idols, blood, strangled animals, and stay away from sexual sin. If you do this, you will be doing well. Take care.

30 After they were sent off, they went to Antioch, and when they had brought everyone together, they gave them the letter.

31 After they read it, they were happy because it comforted them.

32 Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, encouraged the believers with many words and strengthened them.

33 After staying there for a while, they left peacefully to go to the apostles, sent by the believers.

34 Silas was happy to stay there.

35 Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and telling others about God's message, along with many others.

36 Some days later, Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's go back and see how our friends in every city where we shared God's message are doing."

37 Barnabas decided to bring John, called Mark, with them.

38 But Paul thought it was not a good idea to take him along, because he had left them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in their work.

39 They argued so much that they split up: Barnabas took Mark and went to Cyprus.

40 Paul chose Silas and left, with the brothers' blessing to God's grace.

41 He traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
