1 Peter and John went to the temple together to pray at three in the afternoon.

2 A man who couldn't walk since birth was brought and placed every day at the temple gate named Beautiful to ask for money from those going into the temple.

3 Seeing Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked for help.

4 Peter, with John, looked straight at him and said, "Look at us."

5 He paid attention to them, hoping to get something from them.

6 Peter said, "I don't have silver or gold, but I will give you what I do have: In Jesus Christ of Nazareth's name, get up and walk."

7 He took his right hand and helped him up; at once his feet and ankles became strong.

8 He jumped up, stood, and walked. He went into the temple with them, walking, jumping, and praising God.

9 Everyone saw him walking and thanking God.

10 They knew he was the one who used to sit and ask for help at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and they were amazed at what had happened to him.

11 When the man who could not walk and was healed clung to Peter and John, everyone rushed to them in the area known as Solomon's Porch, filled with amazement.

12 When Peter saw this, he said to the people, "People of Israel, why are you surprised by this? Or why do you stare at us as if we made this man walk by our own power or goodness?"

13 God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has honored his Son Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected before Pilate, even when he decided to release him.

14 But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and chose a murderer to be freed for you.

15 They killed the leader of life, but God raised him from the dead; we have seen this ourselves.

16 Believing in his name has made this man strong, whom you all see and know; yes, faith in him has healed him completely before all of you.

17 And now, friends, I know that you did it without understanding, just as your leaders did.

18 God has made happen what he told through all his prophets before, that Christ would suffer.

19 Turn away from your sins and change your ways so that they can be erased when the time comes for God to bring renewal.

20 God will send Jesus Christ, who was already told about to you.

21 Heaven must keep him until the time when everything is made right again, as God promised through all his holy prophets long ago.

22 Moses told our ancestors that God will send you a prophet from your own people, just like me, and you should listen to everything he tells you.

23 Everyone who doesn't listen to that prophet will be removed from the people.

24 Yes, and all the prophets starting with Samuel and those who came after him, as many as have spoken, also predicted these times.

25 You are the prophets' children and belong to the promise God gave to our ancestors, telling Abraham, "Through your descendants, all families on earth will be blessed."

26 First, God raised his Son Jesus and sent him to bless you by turning each of you away from your sins.
