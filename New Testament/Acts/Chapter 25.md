1 When Festus arrived in the area, three days later he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

2 The high priest and the Jewish leaders told him about Paul and asked him.

3 They asked for a favor against him, wanting him to be brought to Jerusalem, planning to ambush and kill him on the way.

4 Festus replied that Paul should stay in Caesarea and that he would go there soon.

5 So he said, "Those of you who can, come with me and accuse this man if he has done anything wrong."

6 After staying with them for over ten days, he went to Caesarea; the following day, he sat on the judge's bench and ordered that Paul be brought in.

7 When he arrived, the Jews from Jerusalem gathered around him and made many serious accusations against Paul that they could not prove.

8 While speaking for myself, I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law, the temple, or the ruler.

9 But Festus, wanting to please the Jews, replied to Paul, "Do you want to go to Jerusalem and be judged for these matters there with me present?"

10 Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's court, where I should be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, and you know this very well."

11 If I have done something wrong that deserves death, I'm not afraid to die. But if I'm not guilty of what they accuse me of, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I want to go to Caesar.

12 Then Festus, after talking with his advisors, said, "Have you asked to go to Caesar? To Caesar you will go."

13 After some time, King Agrippa and Bernice went to Caesarea to greet Festus.

14 After spending several days there, Festus explained Paul's situation to the king, saying, "Felix left a man in jail."

15 In Jerusalem, the Jewish leaders and chief priests told me about him, wanting him to be judged.

16 I replied, "Romans do not hand over anyone to death without letting the accused meet the accusers and defend themselves against the charges."

17 So, when they arrived here, I wasted no time the next day and sat on the judge's bench, and ordered the man to be brought in.

18 When the accusers stood up against him, they did not bring any charges like I thought they would.

19 They had some issues with their own beliefs and about Jesus who had died, but Paul claimed he was alive.

20 Since I was unsure about such issues, I asked him if he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be judged there on these matters.

21 When Paul asked to wait for a trial before Augustus, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.

22 Agrippa said to Festus, "I also want to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he said, "you will hear him."

23 The next day, Agrippa and Bernice arrived with much show. They went into the hearing room with the top officers and leading men of the city. At Festus' order, Paul was brought in.

24 Festus said, "King Agrippa, and everyone here with us, look at this man. All the Jewish people have come to me about him, in Jerusalem and here too, shouting that he should not live anymore."

25 When I discovered he did nothing deserving death and he has asked to go to Augustus, I decided to send him.

26 I have nothing specific to report to you about him. So I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after we question him, I can have something to write.

27 To me, it seems unfair to send a prisoner without stating the charges against him.
