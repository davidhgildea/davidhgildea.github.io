1 When Pentecost Day arrived, they were all together in one place.

2 Suddenly a loud sound like a strong wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.

3 They saw something like flames of fire that were split in two touching each person.

4 Everyone was filled with the Holy Spirit and started to speak in different languages, as the Spirit helped them to speak.

5 In Jerusalem, there were Jews, religious men from every country in the world, living there.

6 When news of this spread, a large crowd gathered, and they were amazed because each person heard them speaking in their own language.

7 Everyone was amazed and surprised, asking each other, "Look, aren't all these people who are speaking from Galilee?"

8 How can we each hear them speaking in our own native language?

9 People from Parthia, Media, Elam, Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,

10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, areas of Libya near Cyrene, visitors from Rome, Jews, and new believers,

11 People from Crete and Arabia, we hear them telling in our own languages the amazing deeds of God.

12 They were all surprised and confused, asking each other, "What does this mean?"

13 Others making fun said, These men have drunk too much wine.

14 But Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and said to them, "You men of Judaea and everyone in Jerusalem, listen to me and hear my words:

15 They are not drunk as you think, since it is only nine in the morning.

16 This is what the prophet Joel talked about.

17 In the last days, God says, I will give my Spirit to everyone: your sons and daughters will tell of the future, your young men will have visions, and your old men will dream dreams.

18 I will pour out my Spirit on my servants and maidens in those days, and they will prophesy.

19 I will show amazing things in the sky above and signs on the earth below; there will be blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.

20 The sun will turn dark, and the moon will turn red, before the great and important day of God comes.

21 Whoever calls on God's name will be saved.

22 People of Israel, listen to this: Jesus from Nazareth was a man shown to be from God to you through miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did through him among you, as you know.

23 God planned for him to be handed over to you, and you took him and had evil men kill him by nailing him to a cross.

24 God raised him up, freeing him from the grip of death, because it was not possible for death to keep holding him.

25 David says about him: "I always see God before me. He is at my right side so I will not be shaken."

26 So my heart was happy, and my tongue was joyful; and even my body will rest with hope.

27 Because you will not leave my soul in hell, nor will you let your Holy One decay.

28 You have shown me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy by being with me.

29 Friends, I want to talk openly to you about our ancestor David. He died, was buried, and his tomb is still here today.

30 Because he was a prophet and knew that God had promised with a strong promise that a descendant from his own body would become the Christ and sit on his throne.

31 He foresaw this and spoke about Christ being raised from the dead. His soul wasn't left in the grave, and his body didn't decay.

32 God raised Jesus, and we all saw it.

33 So, God raised him to His right side and after getting the Holy Spirit as promised by the Father, he has poured out what you now see and hear.

34 David did not go up to heaven, but he said, "God told my lord, 'Sit at my right side.'"

35 Until I make your enemies your footstool.

36 So all the people of Israel should clearly understand that God made Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.

37 When they heard this, their hearts felt troubled, and they said to Peter and the other apostles, "Friends, what should we do?"

38 Peter said to them, "Change your ways, and be baptized each one of you in Jesus Christ's name to have your sins forgiven, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

39 The promise is for you, your children, and everyone far away, as many as God will call.

40 He strongly urged with many other words, "Save yourselves from this wicked generation."

41 People who happily accepted the message were baptized. That day, about three thousand people joined them.

42 They stayed devoted to the teachings of the apostles, to sharing with each other, to eating meals together, and to praying.

43 Everyone felt afraid, and the apostles performed many miracles and signs.

44 Everyone who believed was together and shared everything.

45 They sold their belongings and shared with everyone, giving to each as they needed.

46 They met together every day in the temple, and went from home to home to share meals. They ate happily and with sincere hearts.

47 Praising God and being liked by everyone. And God added to the group every day those who would be saved.
