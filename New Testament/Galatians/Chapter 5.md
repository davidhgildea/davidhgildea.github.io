1 Stay strong in the freedom that Christ has given us, and don't get tied up again in slavery.

2 Listen, I, Paul, tell you that if you get circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.

3 I tell every circumcised man that he must follow the entire law.

4 Christ no longer benefits you, whoever of you try to be right with God by the law; you have lost God's favor.

5 We wait for the hope of being right with God through faith with the Spirit's help.

6 In Jesus Christ, neither being circumcised nor not being circumcised matters, but having faith that shows itself through love does.

7 You were running well; who stopped you from following the truth?

8 This belief does not come from God who calls you.

9 A small amount of yeast spreads through all the dough.

10 I trust you in God to think the same. But anyone who causes you trouble will face their own punishment.

11 And friends, if I still tell people to be circumcised, why am I still being persecuted? Then the problem with the cross would be gone.

12 I wish those upsetting you were gone.

13 Friends, you are called to be free; but do not use your freedom to indulge selfish desires, instead serve each other with love.

14 All the law is summed up in one command: Love your neighbor as yourself.

15 If you hurt and attack each other, be careful that you don't destroy each other.

16 I say this: Live by the Spirit, and you will not satisfy the desires of the body.

17 The body has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit has desires against the body. They are opposed to each other, so you cannot do what you want.

18 But if the Spirit leads you, you are not bound by the law.

19 The actions that come from our human nature are clear. They are: being unfaithful in marriage, having sex without being married, being impure, and wanting forbidden pleasures.

20 Worshiping idols, using magic, hating, fighting, wanting to be better than others, anger, arguing, dividing people, and wrong beliefs,

21 Jealousy, killings, getting drunk, wild parties, and things like these: I warn you now, as I did before, that people who do such things will not receive God's kingdom.

22 The Spirit's fruit is love, happiness, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, and faith.

23 Gentleness, self-control: there is no law against these things.

24 Those who belong to Christ have put to death their human desires and wants.

25 If we live by the Spirit, let's also follow the Spirit's lead.

26 Let's not seek empty praise, causing each other trouble or being jealous of each other.
