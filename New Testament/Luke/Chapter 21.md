1 He looked up and saw the wealthy people putting their gifts into the treasury.

2 He also saw a poor widow put in two small coins.

3 He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has given more than everyone else."

4 All these people gave from their wealth to God's offerings, but she, in her poverty, gave all she had to live on.

5 As some talked about the temple, how it was decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, he said.

6 Look at these things you see, a time will come when not one stone will be left on another; each one will be knocked down.

7 They asked him, "Teacher, when will these things happen, and what sign will there be when these things are about to take place?"

8 He said, "Be careful not to be fooled. Many will come saying 'I am the Christ,' and will tell you the time is close. Do not follow them."

9 When you hear about wars and turmoil, don't be afraid; these things must happen first, but it doesn't mean the end is right away.

10 He told them, "Nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom."

11 Big earthquakes will happen in different places, along with famines and diseases; and there will be scary things and big signs from the sky.

12 Before these things happen, people will capture you and mistreat you. They will take you to religious places and jails, and you will stand before leaders and authorities because of me.

13 It will become a witness for you.

14 Decide in your hearts not to worry beforehand about what to say in your defense.

15 I will give you words and wisdom that none of your enemies will be able to oppose or reject.

16 You will be betrayed by your parents, brothers, relatives, and friends; some of you will even be killed.

17 Everyone will hate you because of me.

18 Not one hair on your head will be lost.

19 Be patient and keep control of yourselves.

20 When you see armies surrounding Jerusalem, know that its ruin is near.

21 Those in Judea should run to the mountains; those in the city should leave; and those in the countryside should not go into the city.

22 These are the days of revenge when everything written will come true.

23 But trouble will come to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days, for there will be great trouble in the country and anger against these people.

24 They will be killed by the sword and taken as prisoners to all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by foreigners until the period of the foreigners is complete.

25 There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; on earth, nations will be in distress and confused; the sea and its waves will roar.

26 People will faint from fear and worry about what is coming upon the world, because the powers of the skies will be disturbed.

27 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

28 When these events start happening, look up and raise your heads because your rescue is near.

29 He told them a story: Look at the fig tree and all the other trees.

30 When they start growing, you see and understand by yourselves that summer is almost here.

31 In the same way, when you see these things happening, know that God's kingdom is very close.

32 I truly tell you, this group of people will not disappear until everything happens.

33 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.

34 Be careful not to let your hearts get weighed down with excess, drunkenness, and the worries of life, so that day won't catch you by surprise.

35 It will come like a trap on everyone living on the entire earth.

36 Stay alert and pray at all times so that you may be considered worthy to avoid all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.

37 During the day, he taught in the temple, and at night, he left and stayed on the hill known as the Mount of Olives.

38 All the people came early in the morning to the temple to hear him.
