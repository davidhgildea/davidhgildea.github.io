1 He also told his disciples, "There was a rich man who had a manager accused of wasting his property."

2 He called him and asked, "Why am I hearing these things about you? Explain your management because you might not be the manager anymore."

3 The manager thought to himself, "What should I do? My master is taking away my job. I can't dig, and I'm too ashamed to beg."

4 I have decided what to do so that when I lose my job, people will welcome me into their homes.

5 He called each of his boss's debtors and asked the first one, "How much do you owe my boss?"

6 He said, "A hundred barrels of oil." Then he told him, "Take your bill, sit down fast, and write fifty."

7 Then he asked another, "How much do you owe?" And he replied, "A hundred measures of wheat." So he told him, "Take your bill and write eighty."

8 God praised the unfair manager, because he acted smartly: for the people of this world are smarter in their own time than the people of light.

9 I tell you, use your wealth to make friends for yourselves, so that when it's gone, they will welcome you into eternal homes.

10 Someone faithful in small things is also faithful in big things; and someone unfair in small things is also unfair in big things.

11 So if you have not been reliable with dishonest wealth, who will trust you with true riches?

12 If you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?

13 A worker can't work for two bosses: he will hate one and like the other, or be loyal to one and not care for the other. You can't work for God and money at the same time.

14 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all he said and made fun of him.

15 He told them, "You try to show people you are right, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is disgusting to God."

16 Before John, there were the law and the prophets; now the kingdom of God is taught, and everyone is trying to enter it.

17 It is simpler for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest part of God's law to be wrong.

18 Anyone who divorces his wife and marries someone else is unfaithful, and anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband is unfaithful.

19 There was a rich man who wore purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.

20 A poor man named Lazarus, who was covered in sores, was placed at his gate.

21 He wanted to eat the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Even dogs came and licked his wounds.

22 The poor man died and the angels took him to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.

23 In hell, he opened his eyes, suffering in pain, and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus close to him.

24 He called out, "Father Abraham, please have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am suffering in this fire."

25 Abraham said, "Son, remember that you had good things in your life, and Lazarus had bad things. But now he is comforted, and you are suffering."

26 Moreover, there is a big gap between us and you: so those who want to go from here to you can't, nor can anyone cross over to us from there.

27 He then said, "Please, father, send him to my father's house."

28 I have five brothers; he should warn them, so they won't come to this place of suffering.

29 Abraham says to him, "They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them."

30 And he said, "No, Father Abraham. But if someone from the dead goes to them, they will change their ways."

31 He told him, "If they don't listen to Moses and the prophets, they won't be convinced even if someone rises from the dead."
