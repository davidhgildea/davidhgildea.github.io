1 After this, God chose 70 more people and sent them in pairs to every city and place where he planned to go.

2 He told them, "The harvest is really big, but there are not many workers. So, ask God, who is in charge of the harvest, to send more workers to gather it."

3 Go: I am sending you like lambs among wolves.

4 Don't take a money bag, a backpack, or extra shoes; and don't greet anyone on the road.

5 Whenever you go into a house, first say, "Peace to this house."

6 If a peaceful person is there, your peace will stay with them; if not, it will come back to you.

7 Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they offer, because workers deserve their pay. Do not move from house to house.

8 When you go into any city and people welcome you, eat what they give you.

9 Cure the sick there and tell them, God's kingdom is near you.

10 Whenever you go into a city and they don't welcome you, leave and say in its streets,

11 We even wipe off your city's dust that sticks to us, but remember, God's kingdom is very close to you.

12 I tell you, on that day it will be easier for Sodom than for that city.

13 How terrible for you, Chorazin! How terrible for you, Bethsaida! If the powerful deeds that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have turned away from their sins long ago, wearing rough clothing and sitting in ashes.

14 Tyre and Sidon will have an easier time on judgment day than you will.

15 You, Capernaum, raised up to heaven, will be pushed down to hell.

16 Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever disrespects you disrespects me; and whoever disrespects me disrespects the one who sent me.

17 The seventy came back happy, saying, "God, even the demons listen to us because of your name."

18 He told them, "I saw Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning."

19 Look, I give you the power to step on snakes and scorpions, and over all the enemy's power: and nothing will hurt you at all.

20 Don't be happy just because spirits obey you; be happier because your names are written in heaven.

21 At that time, Jesus felt very happy and said, "Thank you, Father, God of heaven and earth, because you kept these things from the smart and careful people, but showed them to little children. Yes, Father, this is what you wanted."

22 God has given me all things: and no one knows the Son, except God; and no one knows God, except the Son, and anyone the Son chooses to show him to.

23 He turned to his followers and quietly said, "Happy are the eyes that see what you see."

24 I tell you, many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.

25 A lawyer stood up to test Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what must I do to get eternal life?"

26 He asked him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"

27 He replied, "You should love God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind; and love your neighbor as yourself."

28 He told him, "You have answered correctly: do this and you will live."

29 But he wanted to prove himself right and asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"

30 Jesus replied, "A man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho, and robbers attacked him, took his clothes, hurt him, and left him almost dead."

31 By chance, a priest was going that way, and when he saw the man, he crossed to the other side and walked past.

32 A Levite also came to the place, saw the man, and went by on the other side.

33 A Samaritan on his journey saw the hurt man and felt sorry for him.

34 He went to him, treated his wounds with oil and wine, put him on his own animal, took him to a hotel, and looked after him.

35 The next day, when he left, he gave the innkeeper two coins and said, "Look after him. If you spend more, I'll pay you back when I return."

36 Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by robbers?

37 He said, "The one who was kind to him." Then Jesus told him, "Go and act the same way."

38 As they traveled, he came to a village where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.

39 She had a sister named Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and listened to his teaching.

40 Martha was busy with a lot of serving and went to him and said, "Lord, don't you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me."

41 Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things:

42 Only one thing is important, and Mary has chosen it. It will not be taken from her.
