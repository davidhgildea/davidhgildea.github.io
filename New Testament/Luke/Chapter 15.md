1 All the tax collectors and sinners came close to listen to him.

2 The Pharisees and teachers complained, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."

3 He told them this story:

4 Which one of you, if you have a hundred sheep and one gets lost, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go search for the lost one until you find it?

5 When he finds it, he puts it on his shoulders, happy.

6 When he gets home, he invites his friends and neighbors over and says to them, "Be happy with me because I found my lost sheep."

7 I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven for one sinner who turns from their wrong ways than for ninety-nine good people who don't need to change.

8 If a woman has ten silver coins and loses one, doesn't she light a lamp, clean the house, and look carefully until she finds it?

9 When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors and says, "Be happy with me; I've found the coin I lost."

10 I tell you, there is happiness among God's angels when one sinner decides to change their ways.

11 He said, "A man had two sons."

12 The younger son said to his father, "Father, give me my share of the property." So the father divided his wealth between them.

13 Soon after, the younger son collected all he had, traveled to a distant land, and there squandered his wealth with wild living.

14 After he spent everything, a great famine hit that country, and he started to need things.

15 He went and worked for a local person, and that person sent him to his fields to take care of pigs.

16 He really wanted to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him any.

17 When he realized his situation, he said, "My father's workers have more than enough bread, while I am starving!"

18 I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I've done wrong against heaven and in your sight.

19 I am not worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your paid workers.

20 He got up and went to his father. When he was still far away, his father saw him, felt sorry for him, ran to him, hugged him, and kissed him.

21 The son said to him, "Father, I have done wrong against heaven and before you, and I am no longer good enough to be called your son."

22 But the father told his servants, Get the best coat and put it on him; and put a ring on his finger, and shoes on his feet.

23 Bring the fat calf here, kill it, let's eat, and be happy.

24 My son was gone, and now he's back to life; he was lost, and now he's found. And they started to celebrate.

25 His older son was out in the fields. As he approached the house, he heard music and dancing.

26 He asked one of the workers what was happening.

27 He told him, "Your brother has come back, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he got him back healthy and well."

28 He was angry and refused to go in, so his father came out and pleaded with him.

29 He replied to his father, "Look, I have served you for many years and never disobeyed your orders, yet you never gave me a goat to enjoy with my friends.

30 But when this son of yours came back, who wasted your money with prostitutes, you prepared a feast for him with the best calf.

31 He said to him, "Son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours."

32 It was right for us to celebrate and be happy: because your brother was dead, and now he is alive; he was lost, and now he is found.
