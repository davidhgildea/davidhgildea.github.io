1 On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they went to the tomb with the spices they had made, and some others were with them.

2 They saw that the stone was moved from the tomb's entrance.

3 They went in and did not find the body of Jesus.

4 While they were very confused about this, suddenly two men in bright clothes stood beside them.

5 As they were scared and looked down at the ground, they asked them, "Why are you looking for the living among the dead?"

6 He is not here; he has risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee.

7 The Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, be crucified, and rise on the third day.

8 They remembered what he said.

9 They came back from the tomb and told everything to the eleven disciples and to all the others.

10 Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and other women with them told the apostles these things.

11 What they said sounded like nonsense, and they did not believe it.

12 Peter got up and ran to the tomb; bending over, he saw the linen wrappings lying alone, and he left, amazed at what had happened.

13 Two of them went to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, that day.

14 They talked about all these things that had happened.

15 While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came close and walked along with them.

16 But they could not recognize him because their eyes were prevented.

17 He asked them, "What are you discussing so intently as you walk along, looking so sad?"

18 One of them, named Cleopas, replied, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know the things that have happened here these days?"

19 He asked them, "What things?" They answered, "About Jesus from Nazareth, who was a powerful prophet in actions and words before God and all the people."

20 The leading priests and our leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death and crucified him.

21 We hoped he was the one to save Israel, and what's more, today is the third day since this all happened.

22 Yes, some women from our group also surprised us; they were at the tomb early in the morning.

23 When they did not find his body, they came back saying they had seen a vision of angels who told them he was alive.

24 Some of us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but we did not see him.

25 Then he told them, "You are foolish and slow to trust what the prophets have said:"

26 Shouldn't Christ have suffered these things and entered into his glory?

27 Starting with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them what was said about himself in all the Scriptures.

28 They got close to the village where they were headed, and it seemed like he wanted to keep going.

29 But they urged him, saying, "Stay with us, because it is almost night, and the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.

30 While he was eating with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them.

31 Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; then he disappeared from their sight.

32 They said to each other, "Didn't our hearts feel warm as he talked to us on the road and explained the scriptures to us?"

33 They got up that same hour, went back to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those with them all together.

34 They said, "The Lord has really risen and has shown himself to Simon."

35 They shared what happened on the road and how they recognized him when he broke the bread.

36 While they were talking, Jesus himself appeared among them and said to them, "Peace to you."

37 They were very scared and thought they had seen a ghost.

38 He asked them, "Why are you worried? And why do you have doubts in your hearts?"

39 Look at my hands and my feet, it's really me. Touch me and see; a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones like you see I have.

40 After saying this, he showed them his hands and feet.

41 While they still couldn't believe because of their happiness, and were amazed, he asked them, "Do you have any food?"

42 They gave him some cooked fish and honeycomb.

43 He took it and ate it in front of them.

44 He told them, "These are the words I told you when I was still with you: everything written about me in Moses' law, the prophets, and the psalms must come true."

45 He opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures.

46 He told them, "It is written that Christ must suffer and rise from the dead on the third day."

47 People should be taught to change their ways and be forgiven for their sins in his name everywhere, starting from Jerusalem.

48 You are witnesses of these things.

49 Look, I will send you what my Father promised, but stay in the city of Jerusalem until you receive power from above.

50 He led them to Bethany, raised his hands, and blessed them.

51 While he was blessing them, he left them and went up into heaven.

52 They worshiped him and went back to Jerusalem feeling very happy.

53 They were always in the temple, praising and thanking God. Amen.
