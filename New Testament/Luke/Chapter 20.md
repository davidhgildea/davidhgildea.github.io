1 One day, while he was teaching the people in the temple and sharing the good news, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders approached him.

2 He spoke to him, asking, "Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority?"

3 He replied and said to them, "I will ask you one thing too; answer me:"

4 Did John's baptism come from God or from people?

5 They thought to themselves, "If we say, 'From God,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"

6 But if we say, 'From people,' everyone will stone us because they are convinced John was a prophet.

7 They replied that they did not know where it came from.

8 Jesus said to them, "I won't tell you by what authority I do these things."

9 He started to tell the people this story: A man planted a vineyard, rented it to farmers, and went away for a long time.

10 During the right time, he sent a worker to the farmers, asking for some of the vineyard's fruit; but the farmers beat him and sent him back with nothing.

11 He sent another servant, but they also beat him, treated him badly, and sent him away with nothing.

12 He sent another servant, but they hurt this one too and threw him out.

13 Then the owner of the vineyard said, "What should I do? I will send my beloved son; maybe they will respect him when they see him."

14 When the farmers saw him, they talked to each other and said, "This is the heir. Let's kill him so we can have his inheritance."

15 They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. So, what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

16 He will come and get rid of those farmers, and he will give the vineyard to others. When they heard this, they said, "May God not let that happen."

17 He looked at them and asked, "What does this mean that is written, 'The stone that the builders did not want has become the most important cornerstone'?"

18 Anyone who falls on that stone will break; but if it falls on someone, it will crush that person to dust.

19 The religious leaders and teachers wanted to arrest Jesus right away, but they were scared of the crowd because they knew he told this story about them.

20 They kept an eye on him and sent out spies pretending to be good men to catch his words, so they could hand him over to the governor's control.

21 They asked him, "Teacher, we know you speak and teach what is right, and you don't favor anyone, but teach God's way truthfully."

22 Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?

23 He saw their trickery and asked them, "Why are you testing me?"

24 Show me a coin. Whose picture and inscription are on it? They replied, "Caesar's."

25 He told them, "Give back to the ruler what belongs to the ruler, and give to God what belongs to God."

26 They couldn't catch him in his words before everyone; they were amazed at his reply and kept quiet.

27 Some Sadducees, who say there's no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question.

28 Teacher, Moses told us, if a man dies and has a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and have children for his brother.

29 So there were seven brothers. The first married but died without having any kids.

30 The second one married her, and he died without having children.

31 The third brother married her; and the same happened with all seven brothers: they had no children and then passed away.

32 Finally, the woman died too.

33 So in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? All seven were married to her.

34 Jesus replied, "People in this world get married and are married off."

35 But those who are considered worthy to be part of that world and to be raised from the dead will neither marry nor be married off.

36 They cannot die anymore because they are like the angels and are God's children, as they belong to the resurrection.

37 Now that the dead are raised, Moses showed at the bush, when he called God the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38 He is not a God of the dead, but of the living; everyone lives for him.

39 Some teachers of the law replied, "Teacher, you have spoken well."

40 After that, they did not dare to ask him any more questions.

41 He asked them, "Why do people say the Christ is David's son?"

42 David himself says in the book of Psalms, "God said to my lord, 'Sit at my right side,'"

43 Until I make your enemies a place to rest your feet.

44 David calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?

45 In front of everyone, he spoke to his disciples,

46 Be careful of the teachers of the law who like to wear long robes and enjoy being greeted in the marketplaces, having the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.

47 They cheat widows out of their homes and pretend to be pious by making long prayers. These people will be punished more severely.
