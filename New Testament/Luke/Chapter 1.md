1 Many people have tried to write down the events that we fully believe.

2 Just as those who were there from the start and saw it with their own eyes gave it to us, and they were those who shared the message;

3 I also thought it was a good idea, since I have a full understanding of everything from the start, to write it down for you in an organized way, dear Theophilus.

4 I am making this translation so you can be sure about what you have been taught.

5 During King Herod's time in Judaea, there was a priest named Zacharias who belonged to Abia's priest group. His wife came from Aaron's family, and her name was Elisabeth.

6 They both lived good lives before God, following all God's commands and rules without fault.

7 They had no child because Elisabeth could not have babies, and they were both very old.

8 While he served as priest before God during his assigned time,

9 Following the priest's tradition, his duty was to burn incense when he entered God's temple.

10 The whole crowd of people was praying outside during the time for burning incense.

11 An angel of God appeared to him, standing to the right of the incense altar.

12 When Zacharias saw him, he was upset, and became very afraid.

13 But the angel said to him, "Don't be afraid, Zacharias: your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elisabeth will have a son for you, and you will name him John."

14 You will be happy and joyful; and many will be glad when he is born.

15 He will be great in God's eyes and will not drink wine or strong drinks; he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb.

16 He will turn many Israelites back to God.

17 He will go ahead with the spirit and power of Elijah to bring fathers closer to their children and to guide the disobedient towards what is right, making people ready for God.

18 Zacharias asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am old and my wife is also very old."

19 The angel replied, "I am Gabriel, who stands in God's presence, and I have been sent to talk to you and to tell you this good news."

20 Look, you will not be able to talk until the day these things happen because you did not believe my words, which will come true at the right time.

21 The people waited for Zacharias and wondered why he stayed so long in the temple.

22 When he came out, he could not speak to them; they understood he had seen a vision in the temple because he gestured to them and stayed silent.

23 After finishing his time of service, he went back to his home.

24 After that time, Elisabeth, his wife, became pregnant and kept herself hidden for five months, saying,

25 God has done this for me; he noticed me and took away my shame in front of others.

26 In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth.

27 A young woman promised in marriage to a man named Joseph, from David's family line; and the young woman's name was Mary.

28 The angel came to her and said, "Hello, you are greatly blessed, God is with you: you are honored more than other women."

29 When she saw him, she was upset by his words and wondered what kind of greeting this could be.

30 The angel told her, "Don't be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God."

31 Look, you will become pregnant, have a baby boy, and name him JESUS.

32 He will be great and called the Son of the Most High. God will give him the throne of his ancestor David.

33 He will rule over Jacob's family forever; his kingdom will never end.

34 Mary asked the angel, "How can this happen since I've never been with a man?"

35 The angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come to you, and God's power will cover you. So the holy child born from you will be called the Son of God."

36 Look, your cousin Elisabeth is also having a baby boy in her old age; she's been pregnant for six months even though people said she couldn't have children.

37 With God, nothing is impossible.

38 Mary said, "Look, I'm God's servant; let it happen to me as you said." Then the angel left her.

39 Mary got up at that time and quickly went to a town in the hill country of Judah.

40 She went into Zacharias's house and greeted Elizabeth.

41 When Elisabeth heard Mary greet her, the baby jumped inside her, and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

42 She spoke loudly and said, "You are blessed among women, and the child you will have is blessed."

43 Why should I be honored with a visit from the mother of my Lord?

44 When I heard your greeting, the baby in my belly jumped for joy.

45 Happy is she who believed, because what God told her will happen.

46 Mary said, "My soul praises God greatly."

47 My spirit is happy in God my Savior.

48 God has noticed his servant's humble state; from now on, all generations will say I am blessed.

49 The Mighty One has done great things for me; and His name is holy.

50 God's kindness is for those who respect him, always and forever.

51 He has shown strength with his arm; he has spread out the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.

52 He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up those who were humble.

53 He has given good things to the hungry; but the rich he has turned away with nothing.

54 He has helped his servant Israel, remembering his mercy.

55 He spoke to our ancestors, to Abraham, and to his descendants forever.

56 Mary stayed with her for about three months and then went back to her own home.

57 Elizabeth's time arrived to give birth, and she had a son.

58 Her neighbors and relatives heard how God had shown her great mercy, and they were happy for her.

59 On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the baby and they named him Zacharias, like his father.

60 His mother replied, "No, he will be named John."

61 They told her, "No one in your family has this name."

62 They gestured to his father to ask what name he wanted for the boy.

63 He asked for something to write on, and wrote, "His name is John." Everyone was amazed.

64 Right away, his mouth was opened, his tongue was set free, and he spoke and praised God.

65 Everyone living nearby was afraid, and people talked about these events all over the hill country of Judea.

66 Everyone who heard these things kept them in mind, thinking, "What kind of child will this be?" And God's hand was with him.

67 His father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke God's message.

68 Praise God of Israel, for he has come to and saved his people.

69 And has given us a strong savior in the family of his servant David;

70 God spoke through his holy prophets long ago, from the beginning of the world.

71 We should be rescued from our enemies and from all who hate us.

72 To show the kindness promised to our ancestors and to remember his sacred agreement;

73 The promise God made to our father Abraham,

74 He would let us be free from our enemies so we can serve him without fear.

75 Living holy and right before God, every day of our life.

76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of God, because you will go before God to prepare his paths.

77 To teach his people how to be saved by forgiving their sins.

78 Because of our God's kind mercy, a new light from heaven has come to us.

79 To shine light on those in darkness and near death, to lead our steps toward peace.

80 The child grew up, became strong in spirit, and lived in the deserts until the time came to show himself to Israel.
