1 The time for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, also known as Passover, was near.

2 The high priests and teachers of the law wanted to find a way to kill him; they were afraid of the people.

3 Satan entered into Judas, known as Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples.

4 He went and talked with the chief priests and officers about how he could hand him over to them.

5 They were happy and agreed to pay him money.

6 He promised and looked for a chance to hand him over to them when the crowd was not around.

7 The day came for the bread without yeast when it was time for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed.

8 He sent Peter and John, telling them, "Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat."

9 They asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare?"

10 He told them, "Look, when you go into the city, a man carrying a water jar will meet you; follow him into the house he enters."

11 You will tell the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks you, where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my followers?'

12 He will show you a big room upstairs that's ready: prepare there.

13 They went and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.

14 When the time came, he sat down with the twelve apostles.

15 He said to them, "I have really wanted to eat this Passover meal with you before I go through hard times."

16 I tell you, I won't eat it again until it comes true in God's kingdom.

17 He took the cup, thanked God, and said, "Take this and share it among you."

18 I tell you, I won't drink from the grapevine until God's kingdom comes.

19 He took bread, thanked God, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this to remember me."

20 After supper, Jesus took the cup and said, "This cup represents the new agreement in my blood, poured out for you."

21 Look, the hand of the one who will betray me is with mine on the table.

22 Truly, the Son of Man will go as planned, but how terrible it will be for the man who betrays him!

23 They started to ask each other which one of them would do this.

24 There was also an argument among them about who should be considered the greatest.

25 He told them, "The rulers of the nations rule over them, and those with power over the people are called good leaders."

26 But you must not be like that: instead, whoever is the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and whoever leads should be like someone who serves.

27 Who is more important, the one who sits and eats, or the one who serves? Isn't it the one who sits and eats? But I am with you as one who serves.

28 You are those who have stayed with me through my trials.

29 I give you a kingdom, just as my Father has given one to me.

30 You may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.

31 God said, "Simon, Simon, listen, Satan wants to take you, to shake you like wheat."

32 I have prayed for you that your faith will not fail; and when you turn back, help your brothers be strong.

33 He said to him, "Master, I am ready to follow you, even to jail and to death."

34 He said, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."

35 He asked them, "When I sent you without money, bag, or sandals, did you need anything?" And they answered, "No."

36 He then told them, "But now, if you have a purse, take it, and your bag too; if you don't have a sword, sell your clothes to buy one."

37 I tell you that what is written must happen to me. I must be counted among the wrongdoers, for what is said about me is coming to an end.

38 And they said, "Master, look, here are two swords." And he replied, "That's enough."

39 He came out and went to the Mount of Olives, as he usually did, and his disciples followed him.

40 When he was there, he told them, "Pray so you won't give in to temptation."

41 He moved away from them about as far as you can throw a stone, kneeled down, and prayed.

42 Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me: but let your will, not mine, be done.

43 An angel from heaven appeared to him, giving him strength.

44 Feeling very troubled, he prayed even harder, and his sweat was like big drops of blood falling to the ground.

45 After praying, he went to his disciples and saw they were asleep because they were sad.

46 He asked them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray so you don't give in to temptation."

47 While he was still talking, a crowd appeared, and Judas, one of the twelve, led them to Jesus to kiss him.

48 But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"

49 When the people around him saw what was going to happen, they asked, "Master, should we attack with our swords?"

50 One of them struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear.

51 Jesus responded, "Allow this for now." He then touched the man's ear and healed him.

52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the temple guards, and the elders who came to him, "Did you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a thief?"

53 When I was with you every day in the temple, you did not try to hurt me. But now is your time, and darkness has power.

54 They took him, led him, and brought him to the high priest's house. Peter followed from a distance.

55 When they made a fire in the middle of the room and sat together, Peter sat with them.

56 A servant girl saw him sitting by the fire, stared at him, and said, "This man was with him too."

57 He denied knowing him, saying, "Woman, I don't know him."

58 After a short time, someone else saw Peter and said, "You are one of them too." But Peter replied, "No, I am not."

59 About an hour later, another person strongly said, "For sure, this man was with him too: because he is from Galilee."

60 Peter said, "I don't know what you're talking about." And right away, as he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.

61 God turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered what God had told him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."

62 Peter went out and cried a lot.

63 The men who were holding Jesus made fun of him and hit him.

64 After they covered his eyes, they hit him in the face and asked, "Guess who hit you?"

65 They said many other disrespectful things against him.

66 As soon as it was morning, the leaders and the head priests and the teachers of the law met together and took him into their meeting, asking,

67 Are you the Messiah? Tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe.

68 If I ask you too, you won't answer or let me go.

69 From now on, the Son of Man will sit at the right side of God's power.

70 They all asked, "Are you the Son of God?" He answered, "You say that I am."

71 They asked, "Do we need more evidence? We've heard it from his own mouth."
