1 He told them a story to show that they should always pray and never give up.

2 Someone said, "In a city, there was a judge who did not fear God or care about people."

3 In that city, there was a widow; she approached him and said, "Get justice for me from my opponent."

4 He didn't want to for some time, but later he thought, "Even though I don't fear God or care about people;

5 Since this widow keeps bothering me, I will help her so she won't keep coming and wear me out.

6 God said, "Listen to what the unfair judge says."

7 Won't God protect his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, even though he is patient with them?

8 I tell you, God will quickly make things right for them. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find people with faith on the earth?

9 He told this story to some who were sure they were good people and looked down on everyone else:

10 Two men went to the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.

11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed quietly to himself, 'God, I am thankful that I am not like other peopleâ€”cheaters, unjust, unfaithful in marriage, or even like this tax collector.

12 I skip eating twice a week, I give part of everything I have.

13 The tax collector stood at a distance, wouldn't even look up to heaven, but hit his chest and said, "God, have mercy on me, a sinner."

14 I tell you, this man went home right with God rather than the other: for everyone who lifts himself up will be put down, and he who lowers himself will be lifted up.

15 They also brought babies to him, so he could touch them. But when his followers saw this, they told them off.

16 Jesus called them to him and said, "Let little children come to me, and don't stop them: for God's kingdom belongs to ones like these."

17 I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't accept God's kingdom like a little child will never enter it.

18 A leader asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?"

19 Jesus asked him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God."

20 You know the commands: Don't cheat in marriage, don't kill, don't steal, don't lie about others, respect your father and mother.

21 He said, "I have followed all these since I was young."

22 When Jesus heard this, he told him, "You still need one thing: sell everything you own, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."

23 When he heard this, he became very sad because he was very rich.

24 When Jesus saw how sad the man was, he said, "It's really hard for rich people to get into God's kingdom!"

25 It is easier for a camel to pass through the hole of a needle than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom.

26 Those who heard this asked, "Then who can be saved?"

27 He said, What is impossible for people is possible with God.

28 Then Peter said, "Look, we have left everything and followed you."

29 He told them, "Truly, I tell you, no one who has left home, parents, brothers, wife, or children for God's kingdom,

30 Who will not get much more in this time, and in the future eternal life.

31 He gathered the twelve disciples and said to them, "Look, we're going to Jerusalem, and everything the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will happen."

32 He will be handed over to non-Jews, laughed at, badly treated, and spit on.

33 They will whip him, kill him, and on the third day, he will rise again.

34 They did not understand any of these things; the meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what was said.

35 As he approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road, begging.

36 Hearing the crowd go by, he asked what it was about.

37 They told him that Jesus from Nazareth is passing by.

38 He shouted, "Jesus, son of David, please be kind to me."

39 The people in front told him to be quiet, but he shouted even louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me."

40 Jesus stood up and ordered that the man be brought to him. When the man came close, Jesus asked him.

41 Asking, "What do you want me to do for you?" He replied, "Sir, I want to see again."

42 Jesus said to him, "Get your sight back; your faith has healed you."

43 Right away he could see, and he followed him, praising God; and when all the people saw this, they also praised God.
