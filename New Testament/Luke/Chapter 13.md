1 At that time, some people told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.

2 Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?"

3 I tell you, no: but unless you change your ways, you will all die just as well.

4 Do you think those eighteen people the tower in Siloam fell on and killed were worse sinners than all the other people living in Jerusalem?

5 I tell you, no: but if you don't change your ways, you will all die just as they did.

6 He also told this story: A man had a fig tree in his vineyard; he looked for fruit on it but found none.

7 He said to the vineyard worker, "Look, for three years I've been looking for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down; why should it waste the soil?"

8 He replied, "Master, leave it alone for one more year. I will dig around it and put fertilizer on it."

9 If it produces fruit, good; if not, then you should cut it down.

10 He was teaching in a synagogue on the Sabbath.

11 Look, there was a woman who had been sick for eighteen years, bent over and unable to straighten up at all.

12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, "Woman, you are freed from your sickness."

13 He touched her, and right away she could stand up straight and she praised God.

14 The leader of the synagogue was upset because Jesus healed on the Sabbath. He told the people, "There are six days to work, so come to be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."

15 God answered him, "You hypocrite! Doesn't each of you untie his ox or donkey from the stall on the Sabbath and lead it to drink water?"

16 Shouldn't this woman, a daughter of Abraham, who has been tied by Satan for eighteen years, be set free from this bond on the Sabbath day?

17 After he said this, all his enemies felt ashamed, and everyone was happy because of the wonderful things he did.

18 He asked, "What is God's kingdom like? What can I compare it to?"

19 It is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a big tree, and the birds made nests in its branches.

20 He said again, "What can I compare God's kingdom to?"

21 It is like yeast that a woman mixed into a large amount of flour until it spread through all of it.

22 He traveled through towns and villages, teaching, and headed towards Jerusalem.

23 Someone asked him, "Sir, are only a few people going to be saved?" And he replied to them,

24 Try hard to go through the narrow door, because I tell you, many will try to enter and will not be able to.

25 When the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, and you start standing outside and knocking on the door, saying, "Sir, Sir, let us in," he will answer, "I don't know where you come from."

26 Then you will start to say, "We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets."

27 But he will say, I tell you, I do not know you or where you come from; go away from me, all you who do wrong.

28 You will cry and grind your teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in God's kingdom, but you are thrown out.

29 People will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit in God's kingdom.

30 Look, some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.

31 That day some Pharisees came and said to him, "Leave this place and go away, because Herod wants to kill you."

32 He said to them, "Go, tell that fox, 'Look, I drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will complete my work.'"

33 I must go on my way today, tomorrow, and the next day, because it's not possible for a prophet to die outside of Jerusalem.

34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you; how often I wanted to bring your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you didn't want that!

35 Look, your house is now empty: and I tell you, you won't see me until you say, 'Welcome is the one who comes in God's name.'
