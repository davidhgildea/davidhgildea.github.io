1 He told his followers, "It's impossible to avoid problems, but bad things will happen to the person who causes them!"

2 It would be better for him to have a heavy stone tied around his neck and to be thrown into the sea than to hurt one of these little ones.

3 Be careful with yourselves: If your brother does wrong to you, correct him; and if he is sorry, forgive him.

4 If he wrongs you seven times in a day, and seven times he comes back to you and says, 'I am sorry,' you must forgive him.

5 The apostles said to God, "Make our faith grow."

6 And God said, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you could tell this mulberry tree, 'Be pulled out by the roots and planted in the sea,' and it would listen to you."

7 Which of you, if you have a servant plowing or taking care of the animals, will tell him as soon as he comes in from the field, 'Go and sit down to eat'?

8 Won't you instead tell him, 'Prepare my dinner, put on your apron, and serve me while I eat and drink; after that, you can eat and drink'?

9 Does he thank the servant for doing what was commanded? I don't think so.

10 In the same way, when you have done everything you were told to do, say, 'We are servants who have not earned any favor; we have only done our duty.'

11 As he was going to Jerusalem, he went through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.

12 As he went into a village, ten men with leprosy met him and stood at a distance.

13 They raised their voices and said, "Jesus, Teacher, please help us."

14 When he saw them, he told them, "Go show yourselves to the priests." As they went, they were healed.

15 When one of them saw he was healed, he came back praising God loudly.

16 He fell with his face to the ground at Jesus' feet, thanking him, and he was a Samaritan.

17 Jesus replied, "Weren't ten people cleansed? But where are the other nine?"

18 No one else came back to thank God, only this foreigner.

19 He said to him, "Get up, go on your way; your faith has healed you."

20 When the Pharisees asked him when God's kingdom would come, he replied, "God's kingdom doesn't come in a way you can see it."

21 No one will say, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' because God's kingdom is inside you.

22 He told the disciples, "A time will come when you'll want to see just one of the days of the Son of man, but you won't be able to."

23 People might tell you, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' Don't go or follow them.

24 Just like lightning that flashes from one part of the sky and shines to the other part, so will the Son of Man be on his day.

25 First, he must go through a lot and be rejected by this generation.

26 Just like in Noah's time, it will also be in the days of the Son of Man.

27 They ate, they drank, they got married, they were given for marriage, until the day Noah went into the ark, and the flood came and wiped them all out.

28 Just like in Lot's time, people ate, drank, bought, sold, farmed, and built.

29 On the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from the sky and destroyed everyone.

30 It will be the same on the day when the Son of man is shown.

31 On that day, if someone is on the rooftop and their belongings are inside, they should not go down to get them. And if someone is in the field, they should not go back either.

32 Remember Lot's wife.

33 Anyone trying to save their life will lose it, and anyone who loses their life will keep it.

34 I tell you, that night two men will be in one bed; one will be taken, and the other will be left.

35 Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken, and the other left behind.

36 Two people will be in the field; one will be taken, and the other will be left behind.

37 They replied, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Wherever there is a dead body, that's where the eagles will gather."
