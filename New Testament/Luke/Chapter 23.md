1 The whole crowd got up and took him to Pilate.

2 They started to accuse him, saying, "We caught this man corrupting the nation and telling people not to pay taxes to Caesar, claiming he is Christ, a king."

3 Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He replied, "You say so."

4 Pilate said to the religious leaders and the people, "I find nothing wrong with this man."

5 They became even angrier, saying, "He causes trouble among the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee to here."

6 When Pilate heard about Galilee, he asked if the man was from Galilee.

7 As soon as he found out that he was under Herod's authority, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem then.

8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very happy, because he had wanted to see him for a long time after hearing so much about him; he also hoped to see Jesus perform a miracle.

9 He asked him many questions, but he gave no answer.

10 The leading priests and teachers of the law stood and strongly accused him.

11 Herod and his soldiers ignored Jesus, made fun of him, dressed him in a fancy robe, and sent him back to Pilate.

12 On that day, Pilate and Herod became friends; before that, they had been enemies.

13 Pilate gathered the chief priests, leaders, and the people.

14 He said to them, "You have brought this man to me as someone who corrupts the people. But look, I have questioned him in front of you and have found him not guilty of the accusations you make against him."

15 No, not even Herod, because I sent you to him, and look, he has done nothing that deserves death.

16 I will punish him and then let him go.

17 He had to release one prisoner to them during the feast.

18 They all shouted together, "Get rid of this man and free Barabbas for us."

19 He was put in jail for causing a riot in the city and for murder.

20 So Pilate, wanting to let Jesus go, spoke to them again.

21 They shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him."

22 He asked them a third time, "What wrong has he done? I've found no reason to kill him. So, I'll punish him and then release him."

23 They urgently shouted, wanting him to be crucified. And their voices, along with the chief priests', were stronger.

24 Pilate decided to do what they asked.

25 He freed the one they wanted who was in prison for causing trouble and murder, but he handed Jesus over to do what they wished.

26 As they took him away, they grabbed Simon from Cyrene, who was coming from the fields, and gave him the cross to carry behind Jesus.

27 A large crowd followed him, including women who mourned and cried for him.

28 Jesus turned to them and said, "Women of Jerusalem, don't cry for me, but cry for yourselves and your children."

29 Look, the time is coming when people will say, "Happy are those who cannot have children, the wombs that never gave birth, and the breasts that never nursed."

30 Then they will start to tell the mountains, "Fall on us," and to the hills, "Hide us."

31 If this happens to a living tree, what will happen to a dead one?

32 Two other criminals were also led with him to be executed.

33 When they reached the place known as Calvary, they nailed him to the cross along with the criminals, one on his right and the other on his left.

34 Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, because they don't know what they're doing." They shared out his clothes by throwing dice.

35 The people watched. The leaders mocked him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah, the one chosen by God."

36 The soldiers also made fun of him, went up to him, and gave him vinegar.

37 They said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."

38 A sign was also put above him with the words in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, "This is the King of the Jews."

39 One of the criminals hanging beside Jesus insulted him, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us."

40 But the other one scolded him, saying, "Don't you respect God since you are also being punished the same way?"

41 We are punished fairly, for we are getting what our actions deserve; but this man has done nothing wrong.

42 He told Jesus, "Remember me when you come into your kingdom."

43 Jesus said to him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."

44 It was around noon, and darkness covered the whole earth until about three in the afternoon.

45 The sun turned dark, and the temple's curtain ripped down the middle.

46 When Jesus shouted loudly, he said, "Father, I give my spirit to you." After saying this, he died.

47 When the army officer saw what happened, he praised God, saying, "This man was truly good."

48 All the people who gathered to see what happened beat their chests and then went away.

49 All his friends and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.

50 Look, there was a man named Joseph, who was a counselor; he was good and fair.

51 He did not agree with their plan and action; he came from Arimathaea, a Jewish city, and he also waited for God's kingdom.

52 This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.

53 He took the body down, wrapped it in cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock where no one had ever been laid before.

54 That day was for getting ready, and the Sabbath was about to start.

55 The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was placed.

56 They went back and got spices and ointments ready. Then they rested on the Sabbath day, as the rule said.
