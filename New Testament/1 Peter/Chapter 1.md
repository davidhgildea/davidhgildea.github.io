1 Peter, a messenger of Jesus Christ, to the people living far away in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

2 Chosen by God the Father who knows everything ahead of time, through being made holy by the Spirit, to obey and to be cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ: May grace and peace be given to you in large amounts.

3 Praise be to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, because of his great mercy, has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

4 You will receive an inheritance that cannot be destroyed, stained, or fade, which is kept in heaven for you.

5 You are protected by God's power through faith for a salvation that will be revealed in the end.

6 You are very happy, even though now, for a little while, you may have to be sad because of many tests.

7 The test of your faith is much more valuable than gold that can be destroyed, even though it is tested by fire, so that it may result in praise, honor, and glory when Jesus Christ appears.

8 Even though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and even though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him and are filled with a joy that is so great you cannot describe it, and this joy is glorious.

9 Getting the result of your faith, the rescue of your souls.

10 The prophets who told about the grace that was to come to you searched carefully, wanting to know about this salvation.

11 They wanted to know what time or situation the Spirit of Christ within them was talking about when it predicted Christ's sufferings and the future glory.

12 It was shown to them that they were not serving themselves, but us, by telling the messages now given to you by those who shared the good news with you through the Holy Spirit sent from heavenâ€”messages even angels long to understand.

13 Prepare your mind for action, stay alert, and keep your hope fully on the kindness you will receive when Jesus Christ is revealed.

14 As obedient children, do not shape your lives by the desires you had before, when you did not know better.

15 But since God who called you is holy, you too should be holy in every aspect of your life.

16 It is written, "Be holy, because I am holy."

17 If you ask God for help, who judges everyone fairly by their actions, live your time here with respect and caution.

18 You know you were not saved with things that can spoil, like silver and gold, from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors.

19 With the valuable blood of Christ, like that of a perfect and spotless lamb:

20 He was truly chosen before the world was made, but now has been shown for you in these last days.

21 Through Jesus, you believe in God who brought him back from death and honored him, so your faith and hope can be in God.

22 Since you have made your souls pure by following the truth with the Spirit's help, leading to sincere love for others, make sure you love each other deeply and truly.

23 Being born again comes not from perishable seed, but imperishable, through God's word, which lives and lasts forever.

24 Everyone is like grass, and all their achievements are like the flowers of the field. The grass dries up, and its flowers fall off.

25 God's message lasts forever. And this is the message that is shared with you through the good news.
