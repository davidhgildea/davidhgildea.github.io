1 I urge you, the older leaders among you, as I am also an older leader, a witness of Christ's sufferings, and one who will share in the glory to come.

2 Take care of God's flock that is with you, watch over them because you want to, not because you must, and not for money, but because you are eager to.

3 Not as bosses over God's people, but as examples to the group.

4 When the main Shepherd comes, you will get a crown of glory that never fades.

5 Young people, respect those who are older. Everyone should treat each other with respect and be humble, because God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.

6 So be humble under God's powerful hand, and he will lift you up when the time is right.

7 Give all your worries to God, because he cares for you.

8 Stay alert and watchful, because your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to eat.

9 Stand firm against him by being strong in your faith, knowing that believers all over the world are going through the same kind of suffering.

10 God, full of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory through Christ Jesus, will, after you have suffered for a little while, make you perfect, firm, strong, and steady.

11 May he have glory and power forever. Amen.

12 Through Silvanus, who I believe is a loyal friend to you, I've written a short letter to encourage you and affirm that you are experiencing God's true kindness.

13 The church in Babylon, chosen with you, sends greetings; and so does Mark, my son.

14 Say hello to each other with a friendly kiss. May peace be with all of you who belong to Christ Jesus. Amen.
