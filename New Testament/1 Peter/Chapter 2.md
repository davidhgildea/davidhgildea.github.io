1 So put away all meanness, trickery, pretending, jealousy, and talking about others badly.

2 Like new babies, crave pure spiritual milk so you can grow because of it.

3 If you have experienced God's kindness.

4 Come to Him like you would to a living stone, which people have rejected but which God has chosen and values highly.

5 You too, like living stones, are being made into a spiritual temple, a sacred group of priests, to give spiritual offerings that please God through Jesus Christ.

6 The scripture says, "Look, I put a very important and chosen cornerstone in Zion. Whoever believes in him will not be embarrassed."

7 So for you who believe, he is valuable, but for those who don't obey, the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.

8 A stumbling block and a rock that makes them fall, even for those who stumble over the message because they do not obey: this is what they were destined for.

9 You are a special group, chosen to be kings' priests and a holy nation, different from others; so you can show everyone how great God is, who brought you from darkness into his wonderful light.

10 Before, you were not a people, but now you are God's people; before, you did not receive mercy, but now you have received mercy.

11 Dear friends, I urge you as outsiders and travelers, to avoid bodily desires, which fight against the soul.

12 Live well among non-believers so even if they accuse you of doing wrong, they will see your good deeds and honor God when he examines us.

13 Obey all human laws for God's sake, whether they come from the king, who is highest.

14 Or to leaders, as to those sent by God to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.

15 God wants you to do good so you can silence the foolish talk of ignorant people.

16 As free, but don't use your freedom to hide bad actions, instead live as God's servants.

17 Respect everyone. Love your fellow believers. Be in awe of God. Respect the leader.

18 Workers, obey your bosses with full respect; not just the kind and fair ones, but also the difficult ones.

19 It is good if someone bears pain for doing right because of their conscience toward God, even if they suffer unfairly.

20 What good is it if you endure punishment for doing wrong? But if you do right and still suffer for it, and endure it, this pleases God.

21 You were called to this because Christ suffered for us, giving us an example to follow his steps.

22 He did not sin and no deceit was in his mouth.

23 When people insulted him, he did not insult back; when he was hurt, he did not threaten them but trusted in God who judges fairly.

24 He carried our sins in his body on the cross so that we, free from sins, can live a good life. By his wounds, you have been healed.

25 You were like lost sheep; but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.
