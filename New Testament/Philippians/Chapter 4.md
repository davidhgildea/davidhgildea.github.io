1 So, my dear and cherished friends, whom I miss, my happiness and reward, stay true to God, my dear ones.

2 I ask Euodias, and I ask Syntyche, to agree with each other in God.

3 I ask you too, faithful partner, help the women who worked with me in sharing the good news, along with Clement and my other coworkers whose names are in the book of life.

4 Be happy in God always, and I say again, be happy.

5 Let everyone see that you are considerate. God is near.

6 Don't worry about anything; instead, with thankful prayers, tell God what you need.

7 God's peace, beyond all we can understand, will guard your hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus.

8 Friends, think about things that are true, honest, fair, pure, beautiful, and well-spoken of. If anything is good and deserves praise, focus on these things.

9 Do what you have learned, received, heard, and seen from me, and God, who brings peace, will be with you.

10 I was very happy in God because you could finally show your care for me again; you wanted to before but didn't have the chance.

11 I'm not saying this because I need anything; I have learned to be happy with whatever I have.

12 I know how to live with little, and I know how to live with a lot: in every situation I have learned to be satisfied and to be hungry, to have plenty and to need things.

13 I can do everything with the help of Christ who gives me strength.

14 You did well to help me in my trouble.

15 You Philippians remember that when I first started spreading the good news and left Macedonia, no church helped me with gifts except for you.

16 You helped me with my needs in Thessalonica more than once.

17 I don't want a gift; I want you to have benefits that grow for you.

18 I have everything I need and more. I am satisfied because I received from Epaphroditus what you sent â€“ a sweet-smelling offering, a sacrifice pleasing to God.

19 My God will meet all your needs with the wealth of his glory in Jesus Christ.

20 Let God, our Father, have glory forever and ever. Amen.

21 Greet every holy person in Jesus Christ. My fellow believers with me send their greetings to you.

22 All God's holy people send greetings, especially those from Caesar's family.

23 May the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
