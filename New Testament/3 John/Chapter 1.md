1 The older leader to the dear friend Gaius, who I love truly.

2 Dear friend, I hope that you do well and stay healthy, just as your inner self is doing well.

3 I was very happy when the brothers came and told about the truth in you, just as you live by the truth.

4 I am happiest when I hear that my children live in truth.

5 Dear friend, you are doing a good job whatever you do for the brothers and sisters and for strangers.

6 They have told the church about your kindness. If you help them continue their journey in a way that honors God, you will do well.

7 They went out for the sake of his name and accepted nothing from non-believers.

8 We should welcome such people to help us work for the truth.

9 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to be the most important among them, does not welcome us.

10 Therefore, if I come, I will remind everyone of what he does, like talking bad about us with mean words: he's not only unhappy with this, he also doesn't welcome other believers, stops those who want to, and throws them out of the church.

11 Dear friends, do not follow what is evil but follow what is good. The person who does good is from God, but the person who does evil has not known God.

12 Demetrius has a good reputation with everyone, and with the truth itself. Yes, and we also testify for him, and you know that what we say is true.

13 I have a lot to say, but I won't write it all with ink and pen to you.

14 I hope to see you soon and talk with you in person. I wish you peace. Our friends send their greetings. Say hello to each of our friends by name.
