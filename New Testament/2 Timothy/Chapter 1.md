1 Paul, a messenger of Jesus Christ chosen by God, based on the promise of life found in Christ Jesus.

2 To Timothy, my dear son: May you have kindness, compassion, and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.

3 I thank God, who I serve like my ancestors did with a clear conscience, that I always remember you in my prayers day and night.

4 I really want to see you, remembering your tears, so I can be full of joy.

5 I remember your true faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I am convinced it is in you as well.

6 I remind you to awaken the gift from God you have, which was given to you when I laid my hands on you.

7 God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind.

8 Don't be ashamed of our Lord's message, or of me, his prisoner. But share in the hardships of the good news by the power of God.

9 God saved us and called us with a special callingâ€”not because of what we have done but because of his own plan and kindness given to us in Jesus Christ long ago.

10 But now it is made clear by the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has destroyed death, and has shown us the way to life and eternal life through the good news.

11 I am chosen to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher to non-Jews.

12 I suffer for this reason, but I'm not ashamed because I know who I believe in, and I'm sure he can guard what I've entrusted to him until that day.

13 Keep the pattern of true words you heard from me, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.

14 Protect the good message given to you by the Holy Spirit living in us.

15 You know that everyone in Asia has turned against me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes.

16 God show kindness to Onesiphorus's family because he often helped me and was not embarrassed by my imprisonment.

17 When he was in Rome, he looked for me carefully and found me.

18 May God give him mercy from God on that day, and you know very well how much he helped me in Ephesus.
