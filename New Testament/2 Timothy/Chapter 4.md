1 I command you before God and Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead when he comes and begins his kingdom;

2 Share the message; always be ready, whether it's convenient or not; correct, scold, and encourage with patience and teaching.

3 A time will come when people won't accept true teaching; instead, they will follow their own desires and collect teachers who tell them what they want to hear.

4 They will stop listening to the truth and instead believe in made-up stories.

5 Stay alert in everything, be patient with hardships, do the work of a messenger of good news, and fully carry out your service.

6 I am ready to be sacrificed, and the time for me to leave is close.

7 I have fought well, I have completed my race, I have stayed true to my beliefs.

8 From now on, a crown of goodness is waiting for me, which God, the fair judge, will give me on that day; and not just to me, but to all who look forward to seeing Him.

9 Make an effort to come to me soon.

10 Demas left me because he loved this world and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.

11 Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you, because he is helpful to me in the work.

12 I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

13 Bring the coat I left in Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, but mainly the scrolls.

14 Alexander the metalworker caused me a lot of harm; may God repay him for what he has done.

15 Be careful of him too; he has strongly opposed our message.

16 At my first defense, no one was with me; everyone left me. I hope God will not hold it against them.

17 Despite everything, God was with me and gave me strength, so that the message could be completely spread, and all non-Jewish people could hear it; and I was saved from the lion's mouth.

18 God will rescue me from all evil deeds and keep me safe for his heavenly kingdom. To God be glory forever. Amen.

19 Say hello to Prisca and Aquila, and to the family of Onesiphorus.

20 Erastus stayed in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.

21 Try hard to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers send their greetings.

22 May Jesus Christ be with your spirit. May you have grace. Amen.
