1 Every high priest chosen from people is appointed for people in matters related to God, so he can present both gifts and sacrifices for sins.

2 Who can understand those who don't know, and those who have lost their way? Because that person also has weaknesses.

3 For this reason, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people and also for himself.

4 No one takes this honor for themselves, but only those called by God, just like Aaron was.

5 Christ did not give himself the honor of becoming a high priest; but God, who told him, "You are my Son, today I have become your father," did.

6 God also says in another place, "You are a priest forever in the way of Melchizedek."

7 During his time on earth, when he prayed and pleaded with loud crying and tears to God, who could save him from death, he was heard because he respected God.

8 Even though he was a son, he learned to obey through what he went through.

9 When he became perfect, he caused everlasting salvation for all who obey him.

10 God chose him to be a high priest like Melchisedec.

11 We have much to say about this, but it is difficult because you are slow to listen.

12 By now you should be teachers, but you need someone to teach you the basics of God's message again. You're like babies who need milk, not solid food.

13 Everyone who drinks milk is not experienced in the teaching of right living because they are like a baby.

14 Solid food is for grown-ups, who have trained their senses to tell right from wrong through practice.
