1 Here's the main point of what we've said: We have a high priest who sits at the right side of the throne of God in heaven.

2 A servant of the holy place and the real tent that God set up, not humans.

3 Every high priest is chosen to give gifts and sacrifices, so this man must have something to offer too.

4 If he were on earth, he wouldn't be a priest because there are already priests who give gifts following the law.

5 Those who serve are working with a copy and shadow of the things in heaven, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to build the tent: God told him, "Make sure you make everything according to the design shown to you on the mountain."

6 He now has a greater service because he is the mediator of a better agreement, which is based on better promises.

7 If the first agreement had been perfect, there would be no need to look for a second one.

8 Because he found faults with them, God says, "Look, the time is coming when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah."

9 This is not like the agreement I made with their ancestors when I took their hand to guide them out of Egypt; they did not keep my agreement, so I ignored them, says God.

10 This is the agreement that I will set up with the people of Israel after that time, says God; I will place my rules in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.

11 They won't need to teach their neighbors or their brothers, saying, 'Know God,' because everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me.

12 I will be kind to their wrongs, and I will not remember their sins and bad acts anymore.

13 By saying "a new agreement," he has made the first one old. And what is getting old and wearing out will soon disappear.
