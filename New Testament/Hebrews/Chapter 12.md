1 Since we are surrounded by so many examples, let's get rid of every burden and the sin that trips us up, and run with endurance the race ahead of us.

2 Focusing on Jesus, the starter and completer of our faith; who, because of the joy awaiting him, went through the suffering of the cross, ignored its disgrace, and is now seated at the place of honor beside God's throne.

3 Think about how he put up with so much opposition from sinners, so you won't get tired and give up in your minds.

4 You haven't fought against sin to the point of shedding blood.

5 You have forgotten the encouragement that speaks to you like children, "My child, do not hate God's discipline, nor give up when you are corrected by him."

6 God corrects those he loves and disciplines every child he accepts.

7 If you accept discipline, God treats you like children; because what child is not disciplined by their father?

8 If you are not disciplined, which everyone undergoes, then you are not true children but are like those without a father.

9 We had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shouldn't we submit even more to the Father of our spirits and live?

10 They disciplined us for a short time as they thought best; but God does it for our good, so that we can share in his holiness.

11 At the moment, discipline doesn't seem pleasant but painful. But later, it gives those who are trained by it a peaceful reward of doing right.

12 So, raise your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees.

13 Make straight paths for your feet, so the injured may not be led astray but may heal instead.

14 Seek peace with everyone and live a holy life, because without holiness no one will see God.

15 Watch carefully so no one misses out on God's grace; so that no bitter root grows and causes you trouble, making many impure.

16 Make sure no one is sexually immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his rights as the firstborn for a single meal.

17 You know that later, when he wanted to receive the blessing, he was turned away because he could not change what had happened, even though he cried and tried hard to.

18 You have not come to a mountain you can touch, one that burns with fire, or to darkness, gloom, and storms.

19 They heard the trumpet and a voice speaking words; those who heard the voice begged that no more words would be spoken to them.

20 They couldn't stand the command that if even an animal touched the mountain, it must be stoned or shot with an arrow.

21 The sight was so frightening that Moses said, "I am very scared and shaking."

22 You have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless angels.

23 To the main gathering and community of the first children, whose names are in heaven, and to God the Judge of everyone, and to the spirits of good people made complete,

24 And to Jesus the go-between of the new agreement, and to the blood that was sprinkled, which speaks of better things than Abel's blood.

25 Make sure you do not ignore the one who is speaking. If those who ignored the one who spoke on earth did not get away, we will certainly not get away if we turn away from the one who speaks from heaven.

26 God's voice shook the earth before. But now he has promised, saying, "Once more I will shake not just the earth, but also the heavens."

27 This message, "Once more," means that what can be shaken will be removed, so that what cannot be shaken will stay.

28 Since we are given a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be grateful, so that we can worship God in a way that pleases Him, with respect and awe.

29 Our God is like a fire that burns everything up.
