1 Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the call from heaven, think about Jesus, the messenger and high priest we profess.

2 He was loyal to God who chose him, just like Moses was loyal in every part of God's house.

3 This man was considered more glorious than Moses, because the one who builds the house is more honored than the house itself.

4 Every house is built by someone, but God is the one who built everything.

5 Moses was truly loyal in all God's house as a servant, to witness what would be said later.

6 But Christ is like a son in charge of his own home, and we are that home if we keep our courage and the joy of our hope strong until the end.

7 Therefore, (as God says, today if you listen to his voice,

8 Do not make your hearts hard as you did when you tested me in the desert.

9 When your ancestors tested me, they saw what I could do for forty years.

10 So I was upset with those people and said, "They always go wrong in their hearts; they have never understood my ways."

11 I swore in my anger, they will not enter my place of rest.

12 Be careful, friends, so none of you have an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.

13 Encourage each other every day, while it is still called "Today," so that none of you become stubborn because of sin's trickery.

14 We share in Christ if we keep our first confidence firm to the end.

15 Today, if you will listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did during the rebellion.

16 Some who heard God's message made him angry, but not everyone who left Egypt with Moses did so.

17 But who made God upset for 40 years? Was it not those who sinned, whose bodies dropped dead in the desert?

18 And who did God promise would not enter his place of rest? It was those who did not believe.

19 So we understand they couldn't go in because they did not believe.
