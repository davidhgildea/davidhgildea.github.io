1 So, moving beyond the basic teachings about Christ, let's grow towards complete understanding, without going over the beginning lessons about turning away from useless actions and believing in God again.

2 About the teaching of baptisms, the act of placing hands, the rising of the dead, and forever judgment.

3 We will do this if God allows it.

4 It's impossible for those who once understood, enjoyed the gift from heaven, and shared in the Holy Spirit.

5 And have experienced the good message of God and the powers of the future world.

6 If they turn away again after knowing the truth, it's impossible to bring them back to change their ways; because they are like they are crucifying God's Son all over again, and shaming him publicly.

7 The land that soaks up the frequent rain and produces useful plants for the people who take care of it gets blessings from God.

8 The plant that grows thorns and briers is useless, close to being cursed, and its fate is to be burned.

9 Dear friends, we are confident of better things in your case, things that go with being saved, even though we talk like this.

10 God is fair and won't forget the work and love you showed for His name by serving His holy people, and you still serve them.

11 We want each of you to show the same hard work to be fully sure of your hope until the end.

12 Work hard and follow those who, with faith and patience, receive what God has promised.

13 When God promised Abraham, because there was no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself.

14 I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.

15 After waiting patiently, he received the promise.

16 People truly make promises by someone greater, and an oath ends all arguments for them.

17 God, wanting to show the heirs of the promise his unchanging plan more clearly, guaranteed it with an oath.

18 Through two unchangeable things, where it is impossible for God to lie, we can have strong comfort, as we have run to take hold of the hope offered to us.

19 We have hope as an anchor for the soul, strong and secure, that reaches behind the curtain.

20 Jesus, our forerunner, has entered there for us and become a high priest forever, in the same way as Melchizedek.
