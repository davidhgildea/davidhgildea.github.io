1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and Jesus Christ:

2 May you have grace and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ.

3 We must always thank God for you, brothers, because it is right. Your faith is growing a lot, and the love you all have for each other is increasing.

4 We are proud of you among God's churches because of your patience and faith during all the persecutions and troubles you go through.

5 This clearly shows God's fair judgment, so that you can be seen as fit for God's kingdom, which you are also suffering for.

6 God thinks it is fair to give trouble to those who trouble you.

7 If you are troubled, find rest with us when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven with his powerful angels.

8 With fiery flames, punishing those who do not know God and do not follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9 They will be punished with never-ending ruin, away from God and his mighty glory.

10 When he comes to receive glory in his holy people and to be marveled at among all who have believed (because you believed our testimony to you) on that day.

11 So we always pray for you that God will think you worthy of his call, and will complete every good thing you desire and your work of faith with strength.

12 May our Lord Jesus Christ's name be honored through you, and you through him, by the kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
