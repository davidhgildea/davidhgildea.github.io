1 Friends, please pray for us, so that God's message can spread freely and be honored, just like with you.

2 So that we can be rescued from people who are unfair and evil: not everyone has faith.

3 God is faithful and will make you strong and protect you from evil.

4 We trust in God about you, that you are and will continue to follow the instructions we give you.

5 May God guide your hearts to love God and to wait patiently for Christ.

6 We tell you, friends, speak for Jesus Christ and stay away from anyone who does not follow the teachings we gave and does not act right.

7 You know how you should imitate us: we did not act improperly among you.

8 We did not eat anyone's bread without paying; we worked hard day and night so we would not be a burden to any of you.

9 Not because we lack the authority, but to be an example for you to imitate us.

10 Even when we were with you, we told you: If anyone won't work, they shouldn't eat.

11 We hear that some among you are acting out of line, not working at all, but meddling in others' business.

12 We tell and encourage those people, by Jesus Christ, to work calmly and eat their own food.

13 Friends, don't get tired of doing good.

14 If anyone does not follow our instructions in this letter, take note of that person and do not associate with him, so he may feel ashamed.

15 Don't see him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.

16 May God, the Lord of peace, give you peace at all times and in every way. May God be with all of you.

17 This is my greeting in every letter, all written by me, Paul.

18 May the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with everyone. Amen.
