1 Welcome those who are weak in faith, but don't argue over doubtful issues.

2 One person believes they can eat everything, but another, who is weak, eats only vegetables.

3 If someone eats, they shouldn't look down on someone who doesn't, and if someone doesn't eat, they shouldn't judge someone who does; because God has accepted them.

4 Who are you to judge someone else's servant? They answer to their own master, and will either stand or fall. Yes, they will be supported, because God can make them stand.

5 One person values one day more than another; another values all days the same. Each person should be fully convinced in their own mind.

6 Someone who respects the day does so for God; and the one who does not respect the day also does it for God. The one who eats, eats for God and thanks God; and the one who does not eat, abstains for God and thanks God.

7 None of us lives for ourselves alone, and no one dies for themselves alone.

8 Whether we live, we live for God; and whether we die, we die for God. So, whether we live or die, we belong to God.

9 Christ died, came back to life, and revived so he could be the leader of both the dead and the living.

10 Why do you judge your brother? Or why do you think little of your brother? We will all stand before Christ's judgment seat.

11 It is written, "I am alive," says God, "and everyone will kneel to me and every tongue will admit to God."

12 So every one of us will explain our actions to God.

13 Let's not judge each other anymore; instead, decide that no one should make their brother stumble or fall.

14 I understand and am convinced by Jesus that nothing is unclean by itself; but if someone considers something unclean, then for that person, it is unclean.

15 If the food you eat upsets your brother, you're not acting with love. Don't cause harm to him with your food, the one for whom Christ died.

16 Do not let anyone speak badly of your good actions.

17 God's kingdom is not about food and drink; it's about doing right, peace, and happiness in the Holy Spirit.

18 Whoever serves Christ in these things is pleasing to God and approved by people.

19 Let's try to do things that create peace and help build each other up.

20 Do not ruin God's work for the sake of food. Everything is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.

21 It is not good to eat meat, drink wine, or do anything that makes your brother stumble, get upset, or become weak.

22 Do you have faith? Keep it between you and God. The person who does not feel guilty for what they approve of is happy.

23 If someone eats but has doubts, they are wrong because their eating is not based on belief; anything not based on belief is wrong.
