1 I ask you, friends, because of God's kindness, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice that pleases God, which is a sensible way to serve Him.

2 Do not follow this world's ways: instead, change by renewing your mind to know God's good, pleasing, and perfect will.

3 I tell you, with the kindness given to me, to not think too highly of yourself, but to think sensibly, as God has given each of us a certain amount of faith.

4 Just as we have many parts in one body, and not all parts have the same function:

5 We, though many, are one body in Christ, and each one is a part of each other.

6 Since we have different gifts based on the grace given to us, if it is to prophesy, let us do so in proportion to our faith.

7 If we serve others, let's focus on our service; if we teach, let's focus on our teaching.

8 If you encourage others, do it earnestly. If you give, do it generously. If you lead, do it diligently. If you show kindness, do it happily.

9 Love sincerely. Hate what is evil; hold on to what is good.

10 Show genuine kindness and love to each other like brothers and sisters; give each other more honor.

11 Not lazy in work; passionate in spirit; serving God.

12 Happy in hope; enduring in trouble; always praying.

13 Sharing with those in need; welcoming to others.

14 Be kind to those who are unkind to you; do not wish them harm.

15 Be happy with those who are happy, and cry with those who are crying.

16 Have the same attitude towards each other. Don't aim for high status, but be willing to associate with people of lower position. Don't think you know everything.

17 Don't pay back anyone with harm for harm. Do what is right in everyone's eyes.

18 If you can, try to live in peace with everyone.

19 Dear friends, do not take revenge, but leave room for anger; for it is written, "It is my right to avenge; I will pay back," says God.

20 If your enemy is hungry, give them food; if they are thirsty, give them water; because by doing this, you will make them feel ashamed.

21 Do not let evil defeat you, but defeat evil by doing good.
