1 Because we are made right with God by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

2 Through faith in him, we have been brought into this favor in which we now stand, and we celebrate in expectation of God's glory.

3 We not only do this, but we also take pride in our troubles, because we know that trouble produces patience.

4 Patience brings experience, and experience brings hope.

5 Hope does not disappoint us because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

6 When we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the sinful.

7 It's rare that someone would die for a righteous person, but for a good person, someone might be brave enough to die.

8 God shows his love for us in that, even when we were sinning, Christ died for us.

9 Even more, now that we are made right by his blood, we will be rescued from punishment through him.

10 If we became friends with God when we were his enemies because his Son died for us, we will surely be saved now that we are his friends and because his Son lives.

11 We not only do this, but we also find joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him, we have now received reconciliation.

12 Because one man brought sin into the world, and death came because of sin, death spread to all people since everyone has sinned.

13 Before the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not counted where there is no law.

14 Death ruled from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin like Adam, who represents the one who was to come.

15 The free gift is not like the wrongdoing. If many have died because one person did wrong, God's kindness and the gift he gives freely through one man, Jesus Christ, have reached many more.

16 The gift isn't like the result of one person's sin; the verdict for that one sin was guilt, but God's gift, after many sins, brings us right with Him.

17 If one man's mistake let death rule because of him, even more, those who get lots of kindness and the free gift of being right will live and rule through one person, Jesus Christ.

18 Because one person's mistake led to everyone being judged guilty, the good act of one person gave everyone a free gift leading to life being seen as right.

19 Because one man disobeyed, many became sinners, but because one man obeyed, many will be made good.

20 The law was given so that wrongdoing could increase. But where sin increased, God's kindness increased even more.

21 Just as sin ruled leading to death, so grace also might rule through being right, leading to eternal life, because of Jesus Christ our Lord.
