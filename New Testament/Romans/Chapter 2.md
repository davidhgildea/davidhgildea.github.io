1 So, you can't be excused, person, whoever you are that judges others: because when you judge someone else, you are judging yourself, since you do the same things.

2 We are certain that God's judgment is true and fair against those who do such things.

3 Do you think, man, that if you judge others for doing certain things and then do them yourself, you will avoid God's judgment?

4 Do you look down on the wealth of his kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God's goodness is meant to lead you to change your ways?

5 By being stubborn and unwilling to change, you are storing up anger for yourself for the day when God will show his fair judgment.

6 God will give to each person according to what they have done.

7 To those who keep on doing good and seek glory, honor, and never-ending life, God will give eternal life.

8 But for those who argue and don't follow the truth, but choose what's wrong, there will be anger and punishment.

9 Hard times and suffering will come to every person who does bad things, starting with the Jews and also to non-Jews.

10 But glory, honor, and peace to everyone who does good, first to the Jew and also to the non-Jew.

11 God does not show favoritism.

12 Everyone who sins without knowing God's law will still die, and those who sin knowing God's law will be judged by it.

13 It's not just those who hear the law who are right with God, but those who follow the law will be considered right.

14 For when people who do not have God's law naturally follow what it says, even without the law, they are their own guide.

15 They show that God's law is written in their hearts, their own conscience agrees, and their thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are right.

16 On the day God judges people's secrets through Jesus Christ, following my good news.

17 Look, you are known as a Jew, rely on the law, and take pride in God.

18 You know God's will, and you choose what is best, because you are taught by the law.

19 You are sure that you can guide the blind and be a light for those in the dark.

20 A teacher of the simple, a trainer of the young, who has the outline of knowledge and truth in the law.

21 So you, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who say people should not steal, do you steal?

22 You who say a person should not cheat in marriage, do you cheat? You who hate idols, do you disrespect holy things?

23 You who brag about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?

24 Because of you, people who are not Jews speak badly about God, just like it is written.

25 Being circumcised is good if you follow the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes worthless.

26 So if a person who is not circumcised follows the law's rules, won't that be just like being circumcised?

27 Won't the uncircumcised person by birth, if they follow the law, be able to judge you, who even with the written law and circumcision, break the law?

28 He is not a true Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.

29 A true Jew is one inside; and real circumcision is in the heart, by the spirit, not by written rules. Their praise comes not from people, but from God.
