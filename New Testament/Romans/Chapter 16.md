1 I introduce to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchrea.

2 Welcome her in a way that fits those who are dedicated to God, and help her with anything she needs from you, because she has helped many people, including me.

3 Say hello to Priscilla and Aquila, who help me in Christ Jesus.

4 They risked their lives for me, and not only I am thankful, but also all the Gentile churches.

5 Also say hello to the church that meets in their home. Greet my dear friend Epaenetus, who was the first person in Achaia to follow Christ.

6 Say hello to Mary, who worked very hard for us.

7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives, and my fellow prisoners, who are well known to the apostles, and who also followed Christ before I did.

8 Say hello to Amplias, who I love, as a friend in God.

9 Greet Urbane, our coworker in Christ, and Stachys, my dear friend.

10 Greet Apelles, who is accepted in Christ. Greet those from Aristobulus' family.

11 Say hello to Herodion, my relative. Greet those from Narcissus's family who follow God.

12 Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who work hard for God. Say hello to our dear friend Persis, who worked very much for God.

13 Greet Rufus, chosen by God, and his mother, who is also like a mother to me.

14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers with them.

15 Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, Olympas, and all God's people with them.

16 Greet each other with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ send their greetings to you.

17 I ask you, friends, to watch out for those who create splits and problems against the teachings you've learned; stay away from them.

18 Those people don't serve Jesus Christ but only their own desires. With nice words and smooth talk, they trick innocent people.

19 Everyone knows about your obedience. I am happy for you. But I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil.

20 God, who brings peace, will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

21 Timothy, my coworker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives, send their greetings to you.

22 I, Tertius, the writer of this letter, greet you in God.

23 Gaius, my host and the host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city's treasurer, greets you, and so does Quartus, our brother.

24 May our Lord Jesus Christ's kindness be with everyone. Amen.

25 Now to him who has the power to strengthen you according to my good news, and the message about Jesus Christ, following the revealing of the secret that was hidden since the beginning of the world,

26 Now it is clearly shown, and through the writings of the prophets, by the order of the forever God, made known to all countries for them to obey in faith.

27 God, the only wise one, gets glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
