1 So now, there is no punishment for those who are with Christ Jesus, who do not follow human desires, but follow the Spirit.

2 The Spirit's law of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.

3 The law could not do everything because human weakness made it weak. But God sent his own Son, who was like sinful humans, to deal with sin and to stop sin's power over the body.

4 So that the law's goodness is complete in us, who live not by our selfish desires, but by the Spirit.

5 People who follow their human desires think about human things; but those who follow the Spirit think about spiritual things.

6 Thinking about physical things leads to death, but thinking about spiritual things brings life and peace.

7 The human mind ruled by sin is hostile to God; it does not obey God's laws, and it cannot.

8 Those living by their human nature cannot please God.

9 You are not living according to your selfish desires, but by the Spirit, if God's Spirit truly lives in you. If someone doesn't have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Him.

10 If Christ lives in you, your body is dead due to sin, but the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.

11 If the Spirit of God who raised Jesus from death lives in you, then the one who raised Christ will also give life to your dying bodies through his Spirit within you.

12 So, friends, we do not owe anything to our bodily desires, to live controlled by them.

13 If you follow selfish desires, you will die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the body's wrong actions, you will live.

14 Everyone guided by God's Spirit is a child of God.

15 You have not gotten a spirit that makes you slaves and afraid again; instead, you have gotten a spirit that lets us be God's children, and because of this spirit, we call out, "Daddy, Father."

16 The Spirit itself shows with our spirit that we are God's children.

17 If we are children, then we are heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if we indeed share in his sufferings so that we may also share in his glory.

18 I believe that our current sufferings are nothing compared to the future glory that will be shown in us.

19 All creation eagerly waits for God's children to be revealed.

20 The creation was made to live a pointless life, not because it wanted to, but because God decided, yet gave it hope.

21 The creation itself will also be freed from the chains of decay into the wonderful freedom of God's children.

22 We know that all creation has been groaning as if in pain up to this time.

23 Not just them, but we also, who have the first of the Spirit, sigh deep inside, waiting to be fully brought into God's family, that is, to have our bodies completely freed.

24 We are saved by hope: but if we see what we hope for, it isn't really hope. Why would anyone hope for something they already have?

25 If we hope for what we can't see, we patiently wait for it.

26 The Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit itself speaks for us with sighs too deep for words.

27 The one who knows what we truly think also understands the Spirit's desires, because he speaks to God for the holy people as God wants.

28 We know that everything works for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his plan.

29 God knew some people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son so that his Son would be the first among many brothers and sisters.

30 God chose some people in advance; those he chose, he also invited. Those he invited, he made right with himself. And those he made right, he also shared his glory with.

31 What can we say about these things? If God supports us, who can stand against us?

32 God did not hold back his own Son, but gave him up for us all; won't he also freely give us everything else with him?

33 Who can accuse those chosen by God? God is the one who declares them right.

34 Who can condemn us? Christ, who died and more than that, rose again is at God's right side, and also pleads for us.

35 Who can take us away from Christ's love? Can troubles, or hardship, or attacks, or hunger, or having no clothes, or danger, or violence?

36 It is written, for you we are being killed all day; we are treated like sheep going to be killed.

37 No, in all these things we win completely because of the one who loved us.

38 I am sure that nothing - not death or life, not angels or rulers, not now or later,

39 Not high places, deep places, or any other being can separate us from God's love in Christ Jesus our Lord.
