1 All servants under someone should respect their masters fully, so that Godâ€™s name and teaching are not spoken of badly.

2 If you have a boss who believes, respect them because they are your brothers and sisters. Serve them well because they are faithful and loved, sharing in the good things. Teach and encourage these things.

3 If someone teaches differently and doesn't agree with the good words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching that leads to a godly life;

4 He is arrogant and knows nothing, but obsesses over arguments and fights about words, which lead to jealousy, conflict, insults, and suspicious thoughts.

5 Twisted arguments from people with corrupt minds, who lack the truth and think that profit is the same as being godly: stay away from them.

6 Living a godly life and being content with what you have is truly valuable.

7 We brought nothing into this world, and we can surely take nothing with us when we leave.

8 With food and clothing, let us be content.

9 People who want to be rich fall into temptations, traps, and many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction.

10 Loving money too much leads to all kinds of wrongs; some people wanting it have wandered from their beliefs and brought themselves many pains.

11 But you, man of God, run away from these things; and chase after being right, godly, faithful, loving, patient, and gentle.

12 Battle well in your faith, grab hold of forever life, to which you were invited and have claimed well in front of many people.

13 I instruct you before God, who gives life to everything, and Jesus Christ, who spoke the truth before Pontius Pilate.

14 Make sure you follow this command without fault or blame until Jesus Christ appears.

15 In his own time, he will show who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of all kings and Lord of all lords.

16 Only God has eternal life, lives in light that no one can get close to, whom no one has seen or can see. To Him be honor and lasting power. Amen.

17 Tell those who are wealthy in this world not to be proud or to rely on their unstable wealth, but on God, who generously gives us everything for our enjoyment.

18 Let them do good, be rich in good deeds, ready to share, and eager to be generous.

19 Saving up for themselves a good base for the future, so they may grasp eternal life.

20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, stay away from godless chatter and the false knowledge that some claim.

21 Some who claim to follow have wandered away from the faith. May kindness be with you. Amen.
