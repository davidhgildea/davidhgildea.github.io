1 Paul, a messenger of Jesus Christ, by God our Savior's order, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our hope.

2 To Timothy, my true son in faith: May you have kindness, compassion, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

3 I asked you to stay in Ephesus when I went to Macedonia, so you could tell some people not to teach different teachings.

4 Don't pay attention to myths and never-ending family histories that cause arguments instead of building up God's work, which is done in faith.

5 The goal of this command is love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.

6 Some people have strayed and turned to meaningless talk.

7 Wanting to be teachers of the law without understanding what they are talking about or what they strongly claim to be true.

8 We know the law is good if someone uses it correctly.

9 Understand this: the law isn't for good people, but for those who break the law and don't obey, for godless and sinful people, for those who aren't holy and who disrespect, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, and for murderers.

10 This is for those who are sexually immoral, those who engage in homosexuality, those who kidnap, those who lie, those who make false promises, and anything else that goes against correct teaching.

11 According to the wonderful good news of the happy God, which was given to me to take care of.

12 I thank Jesus our Lord who gave me strength because he trusted me and chose me to serve Him.

13 I used to speak against God, hurt people, and do harm. But I received mercy because I did it without knowing and without belief.

14 God's grace was very great, filled with faith and love in Christ Jesus.

15 This true statement should be fully accepted: Christ Jesus came into the world to save wrongdoers, and I am the worst of them.

16 However, I received mercy for this reason: so that in me, Jesus Christ could fully display his patience as an example for those who would later believe in him for eternal life.

17 Now to the King who is forever, who cannot die, who no one can see, the only smart God, be honor and praise forever and ever. Amen.

18 I give you this task, Timothy, my son, following the prophecies about you, so that you can fight the good fight well.

19 Keep faith and a clear conscience; some have rejected these and ruined their faith.

20 I have handed over Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan so they can learn not to speak against God.
