1 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will turn away from faith, listening to misleading spirits and teachings of demons.

2 Telling lies and pretending to be good, while their consciences are numb as if burned with a hot iron.

3 Stopping people from marrying and telling them not to eat certain foods, which God made for believers who know the truth to eat with thanks.

4 Every creature from God is good and should not be rejected if it is accepted with thanks.

5 It is made holy by God's word and prayer.

6 If you remind the believers about these teachings, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, grown strong through the words of faith and good teaching that you have followed.

7 Avoid disrespectful and silly stories, and instead train yourself to be godly.

8 Exercising your body helps a little, but living a godly life is useful for everything, giving hope for our current life and the future.

9 This saying is true and should be fully accepted.

10 We work hard and are criticized because we trust in God, who saves everyone, especially those who believe.

11 Give these instructions and teach them.

12 Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but be an example for the believers in your speech, in your life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.

13 Until I arrive, focus on reading, encouraging others, and teaching.

14 Do not ignore the gift you have, which was given to you when the elders laid their hands on you and prophesied.

15 Think deeply about these things and fully dedicate yourself to them so that everyone can see your progress.

16 Be careful about how you live and what you teach; keep on doing these things. By doing so, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.
