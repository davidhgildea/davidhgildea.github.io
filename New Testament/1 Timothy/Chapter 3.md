1 It is true that if someone wants to be a leader in the church, they want to do a good thing.

2 A church leader must be without fault, married to one woman, watchful, clear-minded, well-behaved, welcoming to guests, and skilled in teaching.

3 Doesn't drink too much, isn't violent, not chasing dirty money; but is patient, doesn't like to fight, and isn't greedy.

4 Someone who leads their own family well, keeping their children respectful and serious.

5 If a man can't manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?

6 Someone new should not be given a high position, because if they become proud, they might be judged as the devil was.

7 He must also have a good reputation among outsiders to avoid falling into disgrace and the devil's trap.

8 Deacons must be serious, not lie, not drink too much wine, and not want dirty money.

9 Keeping the secret of faith with a clear conscience.

10 First, these should be tested; then if they are found faultless, they can serve as deacons.

11 Their wives must be serious, not spreading rumors, clear-minded, and trustworthy in everything.

12 Deacons should have one wife and manage their children and homes well.

13 Those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus.

14 I write these things to you, hoping to visit you soon.

15 But if I'm delayed, you will know how to act in God's house, which is the living God's church, the support and foundation of truth.

16 There's no doubt, the secret of being good is great: God appeared in human form, proved right by the Spirit, seen by angels, told to outsiders, trusted in by people everywhere, taken up into greatness.
