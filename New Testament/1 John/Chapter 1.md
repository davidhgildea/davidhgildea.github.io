1 What was there from the start, which we have heard, seen with our own eyes, and touched with our hands, is about the message of life.

2 The life appeared, we have seen it, and we tell you about it. We show you the eternal life that was with God and was shown to us.

3 We tell you what we've seen and heard so you can join us. Our friendship is with God and his Son Jesus Christ.

4 We write these things to you so that your joy can be complete.

5 We heard a message from him and now tell you: God is light, with no darkness at all.

6 If we claim to have a close relationship with God but live in the wrong way, we are lying and not living by the truth.

7 But if we live in the truth, as he is in the truth, we share a bond with each other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.

8 If we claim we have no sin, we lie to ourselves, and we don't have the truth.

9 If we admit our sins, God is loyal and fair to forgive us our sins, and to make us clean from all wrongdoing.

10 If we say we haven't sinned, we call God a liar, and his message isn't in us.
