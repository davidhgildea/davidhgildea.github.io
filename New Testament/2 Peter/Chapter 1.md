1 Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, writes to those who share our valuable faith, given through the goodness of God and Jesus Christ our Savior.

2 May grace and peace grow for you by knowing God and Jesus our Lord.

3 God's divine power has given us everything we need for life and goodness, through knowing him who called us to glory and excellence.

4 God has given us very great and valuable promises, so that through them you can share in God's nature, free from the world's corruption caused by human desires.

5 Also, try your best and add goodness to your faith; and to goodness, add knowledge.

6 Add self-control to your knowledge; and to self-control, add patience; and to patience, add devotion to God.

7 Add to being godly, kindness to others; and to kindness to others, love.

8 If these things are in you and grow, they will make sure you are not empty or unproductive in knowing our Lord Jesus Christ.

9 But if someone doesn't have these qualities, they are blind, can't see far, and have forgotten they were cleansed from their past sins.

10 So, my friends, work hard to confirm your calling and choice, because if you do these things, you will never stumble.

11 This way, you will be given a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

12 So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firm in the truth you have now.

13 Yes, I believe it's right, as long as I'm in this body, to remind you and keep you thinking.

14 I know that soon I must leave this body, just as Jesus Christ has shown me.

15 I will try to make sure that after I die, you can always remember these things.

16 We didn't follow cleverly made-up stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; we saw his greatness with our own eyes.

17 He got honor and glory from God the Father when a voice from the magnificent glory said to him, "This is my dear Son, who makes me happy."

18 We heard this voice from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.

19 We also have a more certain message from the prophets. You do well to pay attention to it, like a light shining in a dark place, until the day breaks and the morning star rises in your hearts.

20 Understand this: No prophecy in the Bible comes from someone's own explanation.

21 The prophecy did not come long ago by human will, but holy men spoke from God as they were inspired by the Holy Spirit.
