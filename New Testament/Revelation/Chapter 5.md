1 I saw in the right hand of the one sitting on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.

2 I saw a powerful angel calling out loudly, "Who is good enough to open the book and break its seals?"

3 No one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could open the book or even look inside it.

4 I cried a lot because no one was worthy to open and read the book, or even to look at it.

5 One of the elders said to me, "Don't cry: see, the Lion from the Judah tribe, the Root of David, has succeeded in opening the book and breaking its seven seals."

6 I saw that in the center of the throne and the four creatures, and among the elders, there was a Lamb that looked as if it had been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into the whole world.

7 He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.

8 When he took the scroll, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders bowed down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and gold bowls filled with fragrances, which are the prayers of God's people.

9 They sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the book, and to open its seals: because you were killed, and have bought us for God with your blood, from every family, language, people, and country."

10 You have made us kings and priests to serve our God, and we will rule over the earth.

11 I saw and heard many angels around the throne, the creatures, and the elders. There were millions and millions of them.

12 Shouting loudly, the Lamb who was killed is worthy to get power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise.

13 Every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and everything in them, I heard saying, "Blessing, honor, glory, and power be to the one on the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever."

14 The four creatures said, "Amen." The twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped the one who lives forever and ever.
