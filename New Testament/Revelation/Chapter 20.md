1 I saw an angel come down from heaven with a key to the endless pit and a big chain in his hand.

2 He grabbed the dragon, the ancient snake called the Devil, or Satan, and tied him up for a thousand years.

3 Throw him into the endless pit, close it, and seal it so he cannot trick the nations again until the thousand years end. After that, he will be set free for a short time.

4 I saw seats of power, and people sat on them to judge. I saw those who lost their heads for telling about Jesus, and for God's word, who didn't worship the beast or its statue, and didn't get its mark on their foreheads or hands. They came to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years.

5 The other dead did not come to life until the thousand years ended. This is the first coming back to life.

6 Happy and holy are those who share in the first rising from death: they are not hurt by the second death, but they will serve God and Christ as priests, and will rule with him for a thousand years.

7 After a thousand years are over, Satan will be set free from his prison.

8 The deceiver will go to trick the nations from all over the world, including Gog and Magog, to bring them together for war: their number is as great as the sand on the seashore.

9 They spread out over the earth and surrounded the holy people's camp and the cherished city. Then fire from God fell from the sky and consumed them.

10 The devil who tricked them was thrown into the fire lake with burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet also are, and they will be tormented all the time, forever and ever.

11 I saw a big white seat, and the one sitting on it made the earth and sky run away; there was no place for them.

12 I saw the dead, whether important or not, standing before God. The books were opened, and also the book of life. The dead were judged by what was written in these books, based on what they had done.

13 The sea returned the dead in it; death and the grave also returned their dead; and all were judged by their actions.

14 Death and hell were thrown into the fire lake. This is the second death.

15 Anyone not listed in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
