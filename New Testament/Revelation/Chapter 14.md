1 I looked and saw a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were 144,000 people with his Father's name on their foreheads.

2 I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like loud thunder. I also heard the sound of musicians playing their harps.

3 They sang a new song before the throne, the four creatures, and the elders; and only the 144,000 who were saved from the earth could learn the song.

4 These are the ones who were not impure with women; they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were saved from people, the first to be offered to God and the Lamb.

5 They spoke no lies and are blameless before God's throne.

6 I saw another angel flying high in the sky, with the eternal good news to tell everyone on earth and to every country, family group, language, and people.

7 Speak loudly, respect God, and honor Him; because it's time for His judgment: and adore Him who created the sky, the land, the sea, and the water springs.

8 Another angel followed, saying, "Babylon has fallen, that big city, because she made all countries drink the wine of her anger from her wrong acts."

9 The third angel followed them and shouted loudly, "If anyone worships the beast and its statue, and gets its mark on their forehead or hand,

10 That person will drink from the wine of God's anger, which is poured full strength into the cup of his fury; and they will be punished with fire and sulfur in front of the holy angels and the Lamb.

11 The smoke from their suffering goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and its image, and anyone who accepts the mark of its name.

12 This shows the patience of God's people: they obey God's commands and stay faithful to Jesus.

13 I heard a voice from heaven telling me, "Write: Happy are those who die believing in God from now on. Yes, the Spirit says, they will rest from their hard work, for their good deeds go with them."

14 I saw a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was someone like the Son of man with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.

15 Another angel came out of the temple and called loudly to the one sitting on the cloud, "Put in your sickle and harvest, because the time to harvest has arrived; the earth's crops are fully grown."

16 The one sitting on the cloud swung his harvesting tool over the earth; and the earth was harvested.

17 Another angel came out of the temple in heaven with a sharp sickle.

18 Another angel came from the altar, with control over fire, and shouted to the one with the sharp sickle, "Put in your sharp sickle and cut the bunches of grapes from the earth's vines, because they are completely ripe."

19 The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes, and threw them into the big winepress of God's anger.

20 People crushed the grapes outside the city, and blood flowed from it as high as horse's bridles, stretching for 200 miles.
