1 When he opened the seventh seal, there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour.

2 I saw the seven angels standing before God; they were given seven trumpets.

3 Another angel came and stood at the altar with a gold censer; he was given a lot of incense to offer along with all the saints' prayers on the gold altar in front of the throne.

4 The smoke from the incense, going up with the saints' prayers, rose before God from the angel's hand.

5 The angel took the incense burner, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it onto the earth. Then there were voices, thunder, lightning, and an earthquake.

6 The seven angels with the seven trumpets got ready to blow them.

7 The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood fell to the earth. One third of the trees and all the green grass were burned up.

8 The second angel blew his trumpet, and it looked like a huge mountain on fire was thrown into the sea, making a third of the sea turn into blood.

9 A third of the living sea creatures died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

10 The third angel blew his trumpet, and a large star fell from the sky. It was burning like a torch and dropped on a third of the rivers and on the water springs.

11 The star is named Wormwood; a third of the waters turned to wormwood, and many people died from the bitter waters.

12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and one third of the sun, one third of the moon, and one third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day lost its light, and the night was the same.

13 I saw and heard an angel flying across the sky, shouting loudly, "Trouble, trouble, trouble to the people on earth because of the trumpet sounds from the three other angels that are still to come!"
