1 Write to the angel of the church in Sardis: He who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says, I know your actions; you have a reputation for being alive, but you are dead.

2 Stay alert and make stronger what is left, even though it is close to death, because your deeds are not yet complete in God's eyes.

3 Remember how you have received and heard; keep it firmly and turn away from your wrongs. If you do not stay alert, I will come like a thief, and you will not know when I will come to you.

4 You have a few people in Sardis who have not dirtied their clothes; they will walk with me dressed in white because they are worthy.

5 Whoever overcomes will be dressed in white clothes; I will not erase their name from the book of life, but I will acknowledge their name before God and his angels.

6 If you have an ear, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.

7 Write to the angel of the church in Philadelphia: The one who is holy and true, who holds David's key, who opens doors no one can close, and closes doors no one can open, says these things.

8 I know what you do: see, I have placed an open door before you that no one can close. You have a bit of strength, have obeyed my message, and have not rejected my name.

9 Look, I will make those from Satan's group, who claim to be Jews but are not and are lying, come and bow down before you and understand that I love you.

10 Because you have followed my teaching about endurance, I will also protect you from the time of testing that is going to happen to everyone on earth.

11 Look, I am coming soon. Keep what you have, so that no one will take your crown.

12 Whoever wins, I will make them a strong supporter in the house of my God. They will never leave it. I will write on them the name of my God, the name of my God's city, the new Jerusalem that comes down from heaven from my God, and I will also write on them my new name.

13 Anyone who has ears should listen to what the Spirit tells the churches.

14 Write to the angel of the Laodicean church: The Amen, the reliable and truthful witness, the first of God's creation, says these things.

15 I know what you do; you are not cold or hot. I wish you were either cold or hot.

16 Because you are neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth.

17 Because you say, "I am rich, have lots of things, and need nothing," you do not know that you are truly sad, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.

18 I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire so you can be wealthy; and white clothes to wear, so your nakedness won't be seen; and put salve on your eyes, so you can see.

19 I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be eager, and change your ways.

20 Look, I am waiting at the door and knocking. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and have dinner with him, and he with me.

21 I will let those who win sit with me on my throne, just as I won and sat down with God on his throne.

22 If you have an ear, listen to what the Spirit tells the churches.
