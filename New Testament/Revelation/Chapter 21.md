1 I saw a new sky and a new land because the first sky and the first land had gone, and there was no sea anymore.

2 I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God from heaven, ready like a bride dressed for her husband.

3 I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Look, God's home is now among people, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God will be with them and be their God."

4 God will remove all tears from their eyes; no more death, sadness, or crying; no more pain; the old ways are gone.

5 The one sitting on the throne said, "Look, I am making everything new." Then he told me, "Write these down, because these words are trustworthy and true."

6 He told me, "It's finished. I am the First and the Last, the start and the end. I will give the thirsty person water from the life spring at no cost."

7 Whoever wins will receive everything; I will be his God, and he will be my child.

8 But those who are scared, those who don't believe, those who do bad things, killers, those who sell sex, those who use magic, people who worship idols, and all who lie will go into the lake of fire and sulfur, which means they will die a second time.

9 One of the seven angels, who had the seven bowls with the last seven plagues, came to me and said, "Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife."

10 He took me in a vision to a tall and big mountain and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down from heaven from God.

11 It had God's glory, and its light was like a very precious gem, like a clear jasper stone.

12 It had a large, tall wall with twelve gates, and there were twelve angels at the gates. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel's children were written on the gates.

13 On the east side, there are three gates; on the north side, three gates; on the south side, three gates; and on the west side, three gates.

14 The city's wall had twelve base parts, and on them were the names of the Lamb's twelve apostles.

15 The person speaking with me had a golden rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.

16 The city is shaped like a square, with its length as wide as its width. He measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand stadia. Its length, width, and height are the same.

17 He measured the wall, and it was 144 cubits tall, using a human measure, which is also an angel's measure.

18 The city's wall was made of jasper, and the city itself was pure gold, as clear as glass.

19 The city wall's foundations were decorated with all kinds of valuable stones. The first layer was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald.

20 The fifth stone is sardonyx; the sixth is carnelian; the seventh is peridot; the eighth is aquamarine; the ninth is topaz; the tenth is green chalcedony; the eleventh is orange zircon; the twelfth is amethyst.

21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls; each gate was made from a single pearl. The city's main road was pure gold, clear as glass.

22 I saw no temple there: for God and the Lamb are its temple.

23 The city did not need the sun or the moon for light because God's glory lit it up, and the Lamb was its light.

24 The saved nations will walk in its light, and the earth's kings will bring their glory and honor into it.

25 Its gates will never be closed during the day, because there will be no night there.

26 They will bring the splendor and respect of the nations into it.

27 Nothing unclean, no one who does disgusting things or tells lies will enter it, only those whose names are in the Lamb's book of life.
