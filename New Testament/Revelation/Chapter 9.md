1 The fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fall from the sky to the earth. He was given the key to the bottomless pit.

2 He opened the endless pit; smoke came out like from a big furnace; it made the sun and air dark.

3 Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and they were given power like earth's scorpions have power.

4 They were told not to harm the earth's grass, any green plants, or any trees, but only the people who do not have God's seal on their foreheads.

5 They were allowed not to kill them, but to cause them pain for five months: and their pain was like the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a person.

6 In those days, people will want to die, but they won't be able to; they will long for death, but it will escape them.

7 The locusts looked like horses ready for war; they had what seemed like gold crowns on their heads, and their faces were like human faces.

8 They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like lion's teeth.

9 They wore chest armor like iron, and the noise of their wings was like many horses and chariots rushing into war.

10 They had tails like scorpions with stings, and they could harm people for five months with their power.

11 They had a king, the angel of the abyss, named Abaddon in Hebrew and Apollyon in Greek.

12 One trouble has passed; look, two more troubles will come after this.

13 The sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four corners of the gold altar that is in front of God.

14 Tell the sixth angel with the trumpet to free the four angels tied up at the big river Euphrates.

15 The four angels were set free, who were ready for an hour, a day, a month, and a year, to kill a third of the people.

16 The army of horsemen was 200 million; I heard their count.

17 In the vision, I saw horses and their riders wearing fiery, blue, and sulfur chest protectors. The horses had heads like lions, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths.

18 Through these three, a third of people were killedâ€”by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths.

19 Their strength is in their mouths and tails: their tails are like snakes with heads, and they use these to harm.

20 The other people who were not killed by these disasters still did not change their minds about what their hands had done. They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk.

21 They did not turn away from their murders, magic, sexual sins, or thefts.
