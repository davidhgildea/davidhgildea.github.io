1 I saw the Lamb open a seal, and I heard what sounded like thunder. One of the four creatures said, "Come and see."

2 I saw a white horse, and its rider had a bow. He was given a crown and rode out to win many battles and gain victory.

3 When he opened the second seal, I heard the second creature say, "Come and see."

4 Another red horse came out, and its rider was given the power to remove peace from the earth and make people kill each other. He was also given a large sword.

5 When he opened the third seal, I heard the third creature say, "Come and see." I looked, and there was a black horse, and the rider held weighing scales.

6 I heard a voice among the four creatures say, "A measure of wheat for a coin, and three measures of barley for a coin; but do not damage the oil and the wine."

7 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth creature say, "Come and see."

8 I looked and saw a pale horse. The rider's name was Death, and Hell came with him. They were given power over a quarter of the world, to kill with the sword, hunger, death, and wild animals.

9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because of God's message and their witness.

10 They shouted loudly, "How long, God, holy and true, until you judge and punish those on the earth for our blood?"

11 White clothes were given to each of them; they were told to rest for a little while longer until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were going to be killed like them was complete.

12 I saw when he opened the sixth seal, there was a huge earthquake; the sun turned black like rough cloth, and the moon turned red like blood.

13 The stars from the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree drops its early figs when a strong wind shakes it.

14 The sky split like a rolled-up scroll, and all the mountains and islands shifted from their spots.

15 The world's leaders, important people, wealthy individuals, top officers, powerful individuals, and all slaves and free people hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.

16 They said to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the one on the throne and from the Lamb's anger."

17 The great day of God's anger has come; who can stand against it?
