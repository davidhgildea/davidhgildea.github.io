1 After this, I heard many people in heaven shouting loudly, "Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, honor, and power belong to our God."

2 God's decisions are true and fair: He has judged the great whore who spoiled the earth with her immorality, and has punished her for the killing of His servants.

3 They said again, "Praise God!" And her smoke went up forever and ever.

4 The twenty-four elders and the four creatures bowed and worshipped God on the throne, saying, "Amen; Hallelujah."

5 A voice from the throne said, "Praise our God, all his servants and those who respect him, no matter if you are unimportant or important."

6 I heard what sounded like a huge crowd, like many rivers, and like loud thunder, saying, "Praise God: for God all-powerful rules."

7 Let's be happy and celebrate, and show respect to God: for the Lamb's wedding has come, and his bride is prepared.

8 She was allowed to wear bright, clean, white fine linen, because this fine linen represents the good deeds of God's people.

9 He said to me, "Write, happy are those invited to the Lamb's wedding dinner." He added, "These words are God's truth."

10 I fell at his feet to honor him. But he said to me, "Don't do that: I am a servant like you and your brothers who follow Jesus. Honor God, because following Jesus shows the truth about the future."

11 I saw the sky open, and there was a white horse. The rider was named Faithful and True, and he judges and fights fairly.

12 His eyes looked like burning fire, and he wore many crowns on his head. He had a name that only he knew.

13 He wore a robe soaked in blood, and his name is The Word of God.

14 The armies in heaven followed him on white horses, dressed in clean, white, fine linen.

15 From his mouth comes a sharp sword to strike down nations. He will rule them with an iron stick, and he steps on the winepress of God's intense anger.

16 He has a name written on his clothes and on his thigh, King of Kings, and God of Gods.

17 I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he shouted loudly to all the birds flying in the sky, "Come and gather for the great feast of God."

18 So that you can eat the meat of kings, commanders, strong men, horses, their riders, and all people, free or slave, small or important.

19 I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies come together to fight the one on the horse and his army.

20 The beast was caught, and with it the false prophet who did miracles for it, tricking those who had the beast's mark and worshipped its statue. Both were thrown alive into a fiery lake of sulfur.

21 The rest were killed by the sword of the rider on the horse, the sword that came from his mouth, and all the birds ate their fill of their bodies.
