1 He showed me a clear river of life-giving water, as bright as crystal, flowing from God's throne and the Lamb's.

2 In the middle of the city's main street and on both sides of the river stood the tree of life. It produced twelve kinds of fruit, giving fresh fruit each month. The tree's leaves were used to heal the nations.

3 There will be no more curses; God and the Lamb's throne will be there, and his servants will serve him.

4 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.

5 There will be no night there; they won't need a candle or sunlight because God will give them light, and they will rule forever and ever.

6 He told me, "These words are trustworthy and true. God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show his servants what must soon happen."

7 Look, I am coming soon: happy is the one who follows the teachings of this book's prophecy.

8 I, John, saw and heard these things. After I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me.

9 He said to me, "Don't do that. I'm a servant like you and your fellow prophets and all who follow this book's teachings. Worship God."

10 He said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near."

11 Let those who are unfair continue to be unfair, those who are dirty continue to be dirty, those who are right continue to be right, and those who are holy continue to be holy.

12 Look, I am coming soon, and I bring my reward with me, to give to each one according to what they have done.

13 I am the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

14 Happy are those who follow his instructions, so they can have access to the tree of life and enter the city through its gates.

15 Outside are dogs, magicians, sexually immoral people, killers, idol worshippers, and anyone who loves and makes lies.

16 I, Jesus, sent my angel to tell you these things in the churches. I am the source and descendant of David, and the bright morning star.

17 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." Anyone who hears this should say, "Come." Anyone who is thirsty may come. Anyone who wants to can take the water of life for free.

18 I tell everyone who hears this book's prophecy: If anyone adds anything to it, God will give them the plagues described in this book.

19 If anyone takes away from the words of this prophecy, God will remove their share from the book of life, the holy city, and what is written in this book.

20 The one who tells us these things says, "Yes, I will come soon." Amen. Come, Jesus.

21 May the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with everyone. Amen.
