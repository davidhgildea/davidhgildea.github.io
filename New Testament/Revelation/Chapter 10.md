1 I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven, dressed in a cloud, with a rainbow on his head, his face shining like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.

2 He held an open small book in his hand, and he put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.

3 He shouted loudly like a roaring lion, and when he shouted, seven thunders spoke out.

4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was ready to write, but a voice from heaven told me, "Keep secret what the seven thunders said and do not write it down."

5 The angel I saw standing on the sea and the earth raised his hand to the sky.

6 He promised by the one who lives forever and ever, who made the sky and everything in it, the earth and everything on it, and the sea and everything in it, that there would be no more waiting.

7 But when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet, the secret plan of God will be completed, just as he told his prophets.

8 The voice I heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go and take the small open book from the angel standing on the sea and the earth."

9 I went to the angel and asked him for the small book. He told me, "Take it and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but it will taste as sweet as honey in your mouth."

10 I took the small book from the angel's hand and ate it. It tasted sweet like honey in my mouth, but when I ate it, my stomach felt bitter.

11 He told me, "You must speak God's message again to many people, nations, different language speakers, and rulers."
