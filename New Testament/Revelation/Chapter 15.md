1 I saw another amazing sign in heaven: seven angels with the last seven plagues, because with them God's anger is complete.

2 I saw something like a glass sea mixed with fire, and those who had beaten the beast, its image, its mark, and the number of its name, were standing on the glass sea with God's harps.

3 They sing Moses' song, the servant of God, and the Lamb's song, saying, "Your works are great and wonderful, God Almighty; your paths are right and true, you King of the holy."

4 Who wouldn't fear you, God, and honor your name? You alone are holy. All countries will come to worship you because your fair decisions are clear to all.

5 After that I saw, and look, the temple of the tent of the witness in heaven was opened.

6 The seven angels left the temple with the seven plagues, dressed in clean white cloth, and wearing gold belts around their chests.

7 One of the four creatures gave the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with God's anger, who lives forever.

8 The temple was full of smoke because of God's glory and power, and no one could go into the temple until the seven angels' seven plagues were finished.
