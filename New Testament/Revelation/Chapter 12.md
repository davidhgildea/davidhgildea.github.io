1 In heaven, a great sign appeared: a woman dressed in the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head.

2 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.

3 Another amazing thing appeared in the sky; a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on its heads.

4 The dragon's tail swept away a third of the stars from the sky and threw them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman about to give birth, ready to eat her child as soon as it was born.

5 She gave birth to a boy, who would rule all countries with an iron scepter. Her child was taken up to God and His throne.

6 The woman ran away to the desert, where God had made a place ready for her to be taken care of for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.

7 There was a war in heaven: Michael and his angels battled the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.

8 They did not win, and they were no longer found in heaven.

9 The great dragon, that old snake known as the Devil and Satan who tricks everyone, was thrown down to earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.

10 I heard a loud voice in heaven say, "Now salvation, strength, and God's kingdom, and the power of His Christ are here: the one who accused our brothers, who blamed them before God day and night, has been thrown down."

11 They defeated him through the Lamb's blood and their testimony; they did not hold onto their lives even in the face of death.

12 Be happy, heavens, and all who live there. But sadness for the earth and sea people! The devil has come to you very angry, knowing he has little time left.

13 When the dragon realized he had been thrown down to the earth, he chased the woman who had given birth to the male child.

14 The woman was given two large eagle wings to fly to the wilderness, to her safe place, where she would be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time, away from the serpent.

15 The snake shot water from its mouth like a flood at the woman, to sweep her away with the flood.

16 The earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the flood the dragon spat out.

17 The dragon was angry with the woman and went to fight against the rest of her children, who follow God's commands and have the message of Jesus Christ.
