1 After these events, I saw four angels at the earth's four farthest places, holding back the four winds so that no wind would blow on the land, the sea, or any tree.

2 I saw another angel coming up from the east with God's mark. He shouted to the four angels who had power to harm the earth and sea.

3 Say, do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees, until we have marked the servants of God on their foreheads.

4 I heard how many were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel's children.

5 From the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand were sealed. From the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand were sealed.

6 Twelve thousand from the tribe of Asher were sealed. Twelve thousand from the tribe of Naphtali were sealed. Twelve thousand from the tribe of Manasseh were sealed.

7 Twelve thousand from the tribe of Simeon were marked, twelve thousand from the tribe of Levi were marked, and twelve thousand from the tribe of Issachar were marked.

8 From the Zebulun tribe, twelve thousand were sealed. From the Joseph tribe, twelve thousand were sealed. From the Benjamin tribe, twelve thousand were sealed.

9 After this, I saw a huge crowd that no one could count, from every nation, family, and language, standing in front of the throne and the Lamb. They were dressed in white and held palm branches.

10 They shouted loudly, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."

11 All the angels stood around the throne, the elders, and the four creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God.

12 Saying, "Amen: Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength to our God forever and ever. Amen."

13 One of the leaders asked me, "Who are these dressed in white clothes, and where did they come from?"

14 I said to him, "Sir, you know." He told me, "These are the ones who came from hard times, and they have cleaned their clothes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."

15 So they are in front of God's throne, serving Him day and night in His temple; and the one sitting on the throne will live with them.

16 They will not be hungry or thirsty anymore; the sun and heat will not burn them.

17 The Lamb at the center of the throne will take care of them and lead them to springs of living water, and God will remove all tears from their eyes.
