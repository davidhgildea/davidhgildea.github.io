1 I was given a stick like a measuring rod, and the angel stood and said, "Get up and measure God's temple, the altar, and the people who worship there."

2 Leave out the outer court of the temple and do not measure it, because it has been given to non-Jews, and they will walk all over the holy city for 42 months.

3 I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will speak God's message for 1,260 days, dressed in rough clothing.

4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands in front of the God of the earth.

5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and eats up their enemies. If anyone tries to hurt them, they must be killed the same way.

6 They have the power to close the sky so it doesn't rain during their prophecy, to turn water into blood, and to strike the earth with all kinds of diseases whenever they want.

7 When they finish giving their message, the beast from the abyss will fight them, defeat them, and kill them.

8 Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which in a spiritual sense is named Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord was also crucified.

9 People from different families, languages, and countries will see their dead bodies for three and a half days and will not allow their bodies to be buried.

10 People on earth will be happy about them, celebrate, and give each other presents because these two prophets caused trouble for those living on earth.

11 Three and a half days later, the breath of life from God came into them, they stood up, and those who saw them were very afraid.

12 They heard a loud voice from heaven say to them, "Come up here." And they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched.

13 At that time, a huge earthquake happened, and one-tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people died in the earthquake. The survivors were scared and praised the God of heaven.

14 The second terrible event is over; look, the third terrible event is coming soon.

15 The seventh angel blew his trumpet; loud voices in heaven said, "The world's kingdoms are now God's kingdoms and his Messiah's, and he will rule forever and ever."

16 The twenty-four elders sitting in front of God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God.

17 Saying, we thank you, God Almighty, who is, who was, and who is to come; because you have used your great power and have become king.

18 The nations were angry, your anger has come, the time for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward your prophets, your holy people, and all who respect your name, no matter if they are small or great; and the time to destroy those who have ruined the earth.

19 God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant could be seen inside it. There were flashes of lightning, sounds, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.
