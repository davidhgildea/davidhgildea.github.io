1 I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, "Go and pour out the bowls of God's anger on the earth."

2 The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and there came a painful and bad sore on the people who had the beast's mark and on those who worshiped its image.

3 The second angel emptied his bowl into the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and all life in the sea died.

4 The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they turned into blood.

5 I heard the angel of the waters say, "You are righteous, God, who is, who was, and who will be, because you have made this judgment."

6 They have spilled the blood of holy people and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink because they deserve it.

7 I heard someone from the altar say, "Yes, God Almighty, your decisions are true and fair."

8 The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and he was given power to burn people with fire.

9 People were burned by intense heat, and they spoke against God, who has power over these plagues, but they did not change their ways to honor Him.

10 The fifth angel poured his bowl on the beast's throne, and its kingdom became dark; people bit their tongues from pain.

11 They insulted the God of heaven because of their pain and sores, but did not turn away from their actions.

12 The sixth angel emptied his bowl on the big river Euphrates; the river dried up to make a path for the kings from the east.

13 I saw three dirty spirits like frogs come from the dragon's mouth, from the beast's mouth, and from the false prophet's mouth.

14 They are the spirits of demons, performing miracles, and they go out to the rulers of the world to bring them together for the great battle on God's mighty day.

15 Look, I will come like a thief. Happy is the one who stays awake and keeps their clothes on, so they're not naked and people don't see their shame.

16 He brought them together to a place called Armageddon in Hebrew.

17 The seventh angel emptied his bowl into the air; and a loud voice came from heaven's temple, from the throne, saying, "It is finished."

18 There were sounds and thunder and lightning; and a huge earthquake happened, the biggest ever since humans lived on Earth.

19 The large city split into three, and the cities of nations collapsed. Great Babylon was remembered by God, who decided to make her drink from the cup filled with the strong wine of His anger.

20 Every island disappeared, and no mountains were seen.

21 Large hailstones fell from the sky on people, each weighing as much as a talent; and people cursed God because of the terrible hailstorm.
