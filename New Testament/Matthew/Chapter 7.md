1 Do not judge others, so you will not be judged.

2 The way you judge others is how you will be judged, and the amount you give to others will be the amount you get back.

3 Why do you see the small speck in your brother's eye but not notice the big plank in your own eye?

4 How can you tell your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye,' when you have a log in your own eye?

5 You are two-faced. First, take the large piece of wood out of your own eye; then you will see well enough to remove the small speck from your brother's eye.

6 Don't give holy things to dogs or throw your pearls to pigs, in case they step on them and then attack you.

7 Ask, and you will receive; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.

8 Everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

9 Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?

10 If he asks for a fish, will he get a snake?

11 If you, even though you are not perfect, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?

12 Do to others what you want them to do to you; this is what the rules and the teachings of the prophets mean.

13 Go in through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to ruin, and many people choose that way.

14 The gate is tight and the path is narrow that leads to life, and only a few find it.

15 Be careful of fake prophets who look innocent like sheep but are really hungry wolves inside.

16 You will recognize them by what they produce. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?

17 Just as a good tree produces good fruit, a bad tree produces bad fruit.

18 A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.

19 Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

20 You will know them by their actions.

21 Not everyone who calls to me, 'God, God,' will enter the kingdom of heaven; only the one who does what my Father in heaven wants.

22 On that day, many will say to me, "Master, Master, didn't we speak of the future in your name, drive out demons in your name, and do many great things in your name?"

23 Then I will tell them, I never knew you: go away from me, you who do wrong.

24 So anyone who listens to my words and follows them will be like a smart person who built their house on solid rock.

25 The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew, and hit that house; but it didn't fall because it was built on a rock.

26 Everyone who hears my words and doesn't follow them will be like a foolish person who built their house on sand.

27 The rain fell, the floods came, the winds blew, and hit that house; and it collapsed: and the collapse was big.

28 After Jesus finished speaking, the people were amazed at his teaching.

29 He taught them like someone with authority, not like the scribes.
