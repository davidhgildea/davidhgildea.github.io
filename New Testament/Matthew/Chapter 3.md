1 In those days, John the Baptist came, teaching in the desert of Judea.

2 Say you're sorry, because God's kingdom is very near.

3 This is the one the prophet Isaiah talked about when he said, "A voice calls out in the desert, 'Get the road ready for God, make a straight path for him.'"

4 John wore clothes made of camel hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.

5 People from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and the area around the Jordan River went to see him.

6 They were baptized by him in the Jordan River, admitting their sins.

7 When he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees at his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of snakes, who warned you to escape the coming anger?"

8 Produce actions that show you have changed for the better.

9 Don't think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you, God can make children for Abraham from these stones.

10 The axe is now at the tree roots; so any tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

11 I baptize you with water to show you have changed your heart and life. But the one who comes after me is stronger than I am. I'm not good enough to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

12 He holds a winnowing fork to clean his threshing area and gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn the chaff with a fire that cannot be put out.

13 Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.

14 John stopped him, saying, "I should be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"

15 Jesus replied, "Let it happen now; this is how we do what is right." Then he allowed it.

16 When Jesus was baptized and came up from the water, the sky opened to him, and he saw God's Spirit come down like a dove and land on him.

17 A voice from heaven said, "This is my dear Son, who makes me very happy."
