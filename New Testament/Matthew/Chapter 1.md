1 This book lists Jesus Christ's ancestors. He was from David's and Abraham's family.

2 Abraham had a son named Isaac; Isaac had a son named Jacob; and Jacob had sons, including Judas and his brothers.

3 Judas had Phares and Zara with Thamar; Phares had Esrom; and Esrom had Aram.

4 Aram was the father of Aminadab; Aminadab was the father of Naasson; Naasson was the father of Salmon.

5 Salmon fathered Boaz with Rahab; Boaz fathered Obed with Ruth; and Obed fathered Jesse.

6 Jesse was the father of King David; and King David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife.

7 Solomon had a son named Rehoboam; Rehoboam had a son named Abijah; and Abijah had a son named Asa.

8 Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat fathered Joram; and Joram fathered Uzziah.

9 Ozias was the father of Joatham, Joatham was the father of Achaz, and Achaz was the father of Ezekias.

10 Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah.

11 Josias was the father of Jechonias and his brothers around the time they were taken to Babylon.

12 After they were taken to Babylon, Jechonias became the father of Salathiel, and Salathiel became the father of Zorobabel.

13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud; Abiud was the father of Eliakim; and Eliakim was the father of Azor.

14 Azor was the father of Sadoc; Sadoc was the father of Achim; and Achim was the father of Eliud.

15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar was the father of Matthan, and Matthan was the father of Jacob.

16 Jacob was the father of Joseph, who was married to Mary. Mary gave birth to Jesus, also known as Christ.

17 There are fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the time they were taken to Babylon, and fourteen generations from then to Christ.

18 The birth of Jesus Christ happened like this: Before Mary, his mother, and Joseph were together as husband and wife, she was discovered to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.

19 Joseph, her husband, was a good man and did not want to embarrass her publicly, so he planned to break up with her quietly.

20 As he was thinking about all this, an angel from God came to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, descendant of David, do not be afraid to make Mary your wife because the baby in her is from the Holy Spirit."

21 She will have a son, and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.

22 All this happened to make true what the prophet had said from God.

23 Look, a young woman will have a baby, and she will give birth to a son. They will name him Emmanuel, which means God with us.

24 Joseph woke up, did what God's angel told him to, and took Mary as his wife.

25 He did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to her first son; and he named him Jesus.
