1 Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain. When he sat down, his disciples came to him.

2 He opened his mouth and began to teach them, saying,

3 Happy are those who know they are spiritually needy, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.

4 Happy are those who are sad, for they will be comforted.

5 Happy are the gentle, for they will receive the earth as their own.

6 Happy are those who really want to do what is right, because they will be satisfied.

7 Happy are those who show mercy: they will be shown mercy.

8 Happy are those who have clean hearts, because they will see God.

9 Happy are those who make peace: because they will be known as God's children.

10 Happy are those who are treated badly for doing right: heaven belongs to them.

11 You are blessed when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.

12 Be happy and very glad, because you have a big reward in heaven. This is how they treated the prophets who were before you.

13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and walked on by people.

14 You are the world's light. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.

15 People don't light a candle and hide it under a bowl; they put it on a stand, and it shines for everyone in the house.

16 Let your light shine before others, so they can see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.

17 Don't think that I have come to get rid of the law or the prophets; I haven't come to get rid of them but to complete them.

18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest detail of the law will change until everything is accomplished.

19 Anyone who breaks even the smallest command and teaches others to do so will be least in heaven, but whoever follows and teaches the commands will be called great in heaven.

20 I tell you, unless your goodness is greater than that of the teachers of the law and the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

21 You have heard that long ago people were told, 'Do not kill,' and anyone who kills will face judgment.

22 I tell you, if anyone is angry with their brother for no reason, they are at risk of being judged. If anyone calls their brother 'worthless', they are at risk of the authorities' anger. But if anyone calls their brother a fool, they are at risk of going to hell.

23 If you bring your gift to the altar and then remember that your brother has something against you;

24 Leave your gift in front of the altar and go; first make peace with your brother, and then come and give your gift.

25 Make peace with your enemy quickly while you're still together before they take you to court, and the court hands you over to the guard, and you get put in jail.

26 Truly I tell you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the very last penny.

27 You have heard that long ago people were told, "Do not cheat on your partner."

28 I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman with desire has already been unfaithful to her in his heart.

29 If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

30 If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away, because it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

31 It has been said, if someone wants to divorce his wife, he should give her a divorce paper.

32 I tell you, if anyone divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, he makes her commit adultery; and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

33 You have heard people long ago say, "Do not break your promises, but do what you have vowed to God to do."

34 I tell you, don't swear at all; not by heaven, because it's God's throne.

35 Do not swear by the earth, for it is God's footrest; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

36 Do not promise by your head, because you cannot turn one hair white or black.

37 Let your words be 'Yes, yes' or 'No, no'; anything more than this comes from evil.

38 You have heard it said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

39 I tell you, don't fight against someone who does you harm. If someone hits you on your right cheek, offer them the other one too.

40 If someone takes you to court to take your coat, give them your cloak too.

41 If someone makes you go one mile, go two miles with them.

42 Give to the person who asks you, and do not turn away from the person who wants to borrow from you.

43 You have heard it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'

44 I tell you, love your enemies, be kind to those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat and persecute you.

45 So you may be the children of your Father in heaven: for he makes the sun rise on the wicked and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

46 If you only love those who love you, what good is that? Even tax collectors do that, don't they?

47 If you greet only your friends, what makes you different? Don't even tax collectors do that?

48 Be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
