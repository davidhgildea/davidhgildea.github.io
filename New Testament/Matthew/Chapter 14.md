1 At that time, Herod the ruler heard about Jesus's fame.

2 He told his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that's why he can do powerful things."

3 Herod arrested John, tied him up, and put him in jail because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.

4 John told him, "You should not have her."

5 He wanted to kill him but was afraid of the people, because they thought he was a prophet.

6 On Herod's birthday, Herodias's daughter danced for them and made Herod happy.

7 He promised with a promise to give her anything she asked for.

8 Her mother had told her what to say, so she said, "Give me John the Baptist's head on a plate right here."

9 The king felt sad, but because of his promise and the guests at his table, he ordered that her request be granted.

10 He sent someone and had John beheaded in the prison.

11 They brought his head on a platter, gave it to the young woman, and she took it to her mother.

12 His followers came, picked up the body, buried it, and then went to tell Jesus.

13 When Jesus learned about it, he left by boat to a remote desert area. Hearing this, the people walked from the towns to follow him.

14 Jesus went out, saw many people, felt sorry for them, and healed their sick.

15 In the evening, his followers came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's getting late; tell the crowd to leave so they can go to the nearby towns and buy food for themselves."

16 Jesus said to them, "They don't need to leave; give them something to eat."

17 They said to him, "We only have five loaves of bread and two fish here."

18 He said, "Bring them here to me."

19 He told the people to sit on the grass, took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to the sky, said a blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his followers, who then gave it to everyone.

20 Everyone ate and was satisfied, and they gathered twelve baskets full of leftover pieces.

21 About five thousand men ate, not counting women and children.

22 Right away, Jesus made his disciples get into a boat and go ahead of him to the other side while he sent the crowds away.

23 After he told the crowds to go, he went up a mountain by himself to pray. When night came, he was there alone.

24 The boat was in the middle of the sea, being thrown about by waves, because the wind was against it.

25 In the last part of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the water.

26 When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they were scared and said, "It's a ghost!" and they screamed with fear.

27 Right away Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Be happy; it's me; don't be scared."

28 Peter answered, "Lord, if it's really you, tell me to come to you on the water."

29 He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus.

30 But when he saw the strong wind, he was scared; and starting to sink, he shouted, "God, save me."

31 Right away, Jesus reached out his hand, grabbed him, and said, "You with little faith, why did you doubt?"

32 When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.

33 The people in the boat came to him and honored him, saying, "Truly, you are the Son of God."

34 After they crossed over, they arrived in the land of Gennesaret.

35 When the people there recognized him, they spread the word throughout the region and brought all the sick to him.

36 They asked to touch just the edge of his clothes, and everyone who touched it was completely healed.
