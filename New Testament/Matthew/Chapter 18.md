1 The disciples came to Jesus then, asking, "Who is the greatest in heaven's kingdom?"

2 Jesus called a child over and had him stand among them.

3 Truly, I tell you, if you don't change and become like little children, you won't enter the kingdom of heaven.

4 Anyone who humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in heaven's kingdom.

5 Anyone who welcomes a little child because of me is welcoming me.

6 But if anyone hurts one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for them to have a heavy stone tied around their neck and to be drowned in the deep sea.

7 Trouble comes to the world because of wrongs; wrongs must happen, but trouble comes to the person who causes the wrong.

8 If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It's better to live with one hand or foot than to have two and be thrown into eternal fire.

9 If your eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away. It's better to live with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.

10 Be careful not to look down on any of these little ones, because I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my God in heaven.

11 The Son of Man came to save what was lost.

12 What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one gets lost, won't he leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to look for the lost one?

13 If he finds it, truly, I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.

14 God in heaven does not want even one of these little ones to be lost.

15 If your brother does wrong to you, go and point out his mistake, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.

16 If he doesn't listen to you, bring one or two others with you, so that the truth of every word can be confirmed by two or three witnesses.

17 If he ignores them, tell the church. But if he ignores the church, treat him like a stranger or a tax collector.

18 I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.

19 I tell you again, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.

20 When two or three people meet in my name, I am there with them.

21 Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"

22 Jesus said to him, "I don't mean seven times, but seventy times seven."

23 The kingdom of heaven is compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.

24 When he started to settle accounts, someone was brought to him who owed him ten thousand coins.

25 Since he couldn't pay, his master ordered that he, his wife, his children, and everything he owned be sold to pay the debt.

26 The servant knelt down and begged him, saying, "Master, please wait, and I will pay you everything."

27 The master of the servant felt sorry for him, set him free, and canceled his debt.

28 The servant went out and found a fellow servant who owed him a small amount of money. He grabbed him and choked him, saying, "Pay back what you owe me."

29 His coworker knelt down and begged him, saying, "Please be patient with me, and I will pay you everything."

30 He refused and put him in jail until he could pay back the money.

31 When his fellow servants saw what happened, they were very sad and went to tell their master everything that happened.

32 Then his master, after calling him, said to him, 'You evil servant, I forgave all your debt because you asked me to.

33 Shouldn't you also have shown mercy to your fellow servant, just as I showed mercy to you?

34 His master was angry and handed him over to the jailers until he could pay back everything he owed.

35 In the same way, my Father in heaven will treat you, unless you truly forgive everyone for the wrongs they have done to you.
