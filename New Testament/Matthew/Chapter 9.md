1 He got into a boat, crossed over, and arrived at his own city.

2 Look, they brought to Jesus a man with paralysis, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralyzed man, "Young man, cheer up; your sins are forgiven."

3 Some teachers of the law thought to themselves, "This man is speaking against God."

4 Jesus, aware of their thoughts, asked, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?"

5 Which is simpler: to say 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say 'Get up and walk'?

6 I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, so he said to the man with paralysis, "Get up, pick up your mat, and go home."

7 He got up and went to his home.

8 When the crowds saw this, they were amazed and praised God for giving such power to people.

9 As Jesus left that place, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office. He said to him, "Follow me." Matthew got up and followed him.

10 As Jesus was eating in the house, many tax collectors and wrongdoers came and ate with him and his followers.

11 When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"

12 When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Healthy people don't need a doctor, but sick people do."

13 Go and understand this: I desire kindness, not offerings. I came not to call the good people, but sinners to turn away from their sins.

14 John's followers came to Jesus and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but your disciples do not fast?"

15 Jesus asked them, "Can wedding guests be sad while the groom is with them? But a time will come when the groom will be taken away, and then they will fast."

16 No one sews a piece of new fabric onto an old clothing because the patch will pull away from it, making the tear worse.

17 People don't put new wine into old containers; otherwise, the containers will break, the wine will spill, and the containers will be ruined. Instead, they put new wine into new containers, and both stay good.

18 While he was speaking to them, look, a leader came and bowed down to him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But if you come and put your hand on her, she will live."

19 Jesus got up, followed him, and his disciples did too.

20 Look, a woman who had been sick with bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his clothes.

21 She thought, "If I can just touch his clothes, I will be healed."

22 Jesus turned around, and when he saw her, he said, "Daughter, be encouraged; your faith has healed you." And from that moment, the woman was healed.

23 When Jesus entered the leader's home and saw the musicians and the noisy crowd,

24 He told them, "Move aside: the girl is not dead, but sleeping." And they laughed at him.

25 After the crowd was sent outside, he went in, took her hand, and the girl got up.

26 News of this spread throughout the entire area.

27 When Jesus left that place, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Son of David, have mercy on us."

28 When he entered the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus asked them, "Do you believe I can do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."

29 He touched their eyes and said, "Let it happen for you as you believe."

30 Their eyes were opened, and Jesus firmly told them, "Make sure no one finds out about this."

31 After they left, they told everyone about him everywhere in that area.

32 As they left, they brought to Jesus a man who could not speak because he had a demon.

33 When the devil was driven away, the person who could not talk spoke, and the crowds were amazed, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."

34 The Pharisees said, He drives out evil spirits using the ruler of the evil spirits.

35 Jesus traveled through all the cities and villages, teaching in their places of worship, spreading the good news of the kingdom, and curing every illness and disease among the people.

36 When he saw the crowds, he felt sorry for them because they were weak and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.

37 He said to his students, "There really is a lot of crop, but there are not many workers."

38 Ask God, who takes care of the harvest, to send workers for gathering it.
