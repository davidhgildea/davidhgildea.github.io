1 At the end of the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was starting, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.

2 Look, there was a big earthquake because an angel from God came down from heaven, moved the stone from the entrance, and sat on it.

3 His face shone like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.

4 The guards were so afraid of him that they trembled and became like men who were dead.

5 The angel said to the women, "Don't be afraid. I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."

6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see where he was lying.

7 Go fast, and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead. Look, he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there. I have told you now.

8 They left the tomb quickly, feeling afraid yet very happy, and ran to tell his disciples.

9 As they were going to tell his disciples, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings." They came, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.

10 Jesus told them, "Don't be scared. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see me there."

11 As they were leaving, look, some of the guards went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.

12 When they met with the leaders and made their plan, they paid the soldiers a lot of money.

13 Say, "His followers came at night and took him while we were sleeping."

14 If the governor hears about this, we will talk to him and protect you.

15 They took the money and did what they were told, and people still tell this story among the Jews today.

16 Then the eleven followers went to Galilee, to a mountain where Jesus had told them to go.

17 When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some were unsure.

18 Jesus came and said to them, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth."

19 Go and teach all people, baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

20 Teach them to follow everything I have told you: and remember, I am with you always, to the end of time. Amen.
