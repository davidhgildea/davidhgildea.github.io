1 The Pharisees and Sadducees also came to Jesus and, trying to trick him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.

2 He replied, "When the evening comes, you say, 'The weather will be good,' because the sky is red."

3 In the morning, the weather will be bad today because the sky is red and dark. You hypocrites, you can tell what the sky looks like, but can't you tell what's happening in these times?

4 A bad and unfaithful generation looks for a sign; no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Then he left them and went away.

5 When his disciples reached the other side, they realized they had forgotten to bring bread.

6 Jesus told them, "Be careful and watch out for the influence of the Pharisees and Sadducees."

7 They talked to each other, saying, "It's because we didn't bring any bread."

8 When Jesus noticed, he said to them, "You with little faith, why are you discussing that you have no bread?"

9 Don't you understand or remember the five loaves for the five thousand people and the number of baskets you gathered?

10 Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you collected?

11 Why don't you understand that I was not talking about bread? Be careful of the Pharisees' and Sadducees' teachings.

12 Then they realized he was not telling them to watch out for the yeast in bread, but to be cautious of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

13 When Jesus arrived in the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his followers, "Who do people say that I, the Son of Man, am?"

14 They said, "Some think you are John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others think you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets."

15 He asks them, "But who do you say I am?"

16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."

17 Jesus replied to him, "You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because this was not shown to you by humans, but by my Father in heaven."

18 I also tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.

19 I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.

20 He told his disciples not to tell anyone that he was Jesus the Christ.

21 From that time, Jesus started to explain to his followers that he had to go to Jerusalem, face many troubles from the leaders, the main priests, and the teachers of the law, be put to death, and come back to life on the third day.

22 Then Peter took him aside and started to scold him, saying, "Don't let this happen to you, Lord; this must not happen to you."

23 He turned and said to Peter, "Go away from me, Satan! You are a problem to me because you don't care about what comes from God, but only what comes from people."

24 Jesus told his followers, "If anyone wants to follow me, they must forget about themselves, carry their cross, and come with me."

25 Whoever wants to save their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for me will find it.

26 What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet lose their own life? Or what can someone give to get back their life?

27 The Son of Man will come with the brightness of his Father and his angels; and then he will give each person what they deserve for what they have done.

28 I tell you the truth, some standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man arriving in his kingdom.
