1 Employers, treat your workers fairly and equally, because you know you also have a Master in heaven.

2 Keep praying, and stay alert when you do, with gratitude.

3 Please pray for us too, that God will give us a chance to share Christ's secret message, for which I am in chains.

4 So I can clearly explain it, as I should.

5 Live wisely around those who are not believers, using your time well.

6 Always speak kindly and thoughtfully, so you know how to reply to anyone.

7 Tychicus will tell you all about how I'm doing. He is a dear brother, a reliable helper, and someone who serves God with us.

8 I sent him to you for this reason, so he can learn about your situation and give you comfort.

9 Onesimus, a loyal and dear brother, who is one of you, will tell you everything that's happening here.

10 Aristarchus, who is in prison with me, sends greetings to you, and so does Mark, Barnabas's cousin. You've been told about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.

11 Jesus, called Justus, and others who are circumcised are the only ones working with me for God's kingdom and have comforted me.

12 Epaphras, who is one of you and serves Christ, greets you. He always works hard in prayer for you, so you can be fully mature and do all that God wants.

13 I can tell you, he is very eager to help you and also those in Laodicea and Hierapolis.

14 Luke, our dear doctor, and Demas, say hello to you.

15 Greet the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, Nymphas, and the church that meets at his home.

16 When you read this letter, make sure it is also read in the Laodicean church, and that you read the letter from Laodicea too.

17 Tell Archippus: Pay attention to the service you were given by God and make sure you complete it.

18 I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand. Remember that I am in chains. May God's kindness be with you. Amen.
