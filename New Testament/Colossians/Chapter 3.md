1 If you have been raised with Christ, look for the things that are above, where Christ sits at God's right side.

2 Focus on things above, not on earthly things.

3 You are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

4 When Christ, who is our life, comes, you will also be with him in glory.

5 So, make dead the parts of you that are earthly: sexual sin, impurity, strong lust, evil desires, and greed, which is like worshiping idols.

6 Because of these things, God's anger comes upon the disobedient people.

7 You once lived this way when you followed these practices.

8 Now you should also stop all these things: anger, rage, hate, insulting others, and dirty talk from your mouth.

9 Do not lie to each other, because you have taken off your old self and its behaviors.

10 And have put on the new self, which is renewed in knowledge to be like God who created him.

11 There is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or not, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free; but Christ is everything and in everyone.

12 Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and loved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.

13 Be patient with each other, and forgive each other. If someone has a complaint against anyone, forgive them just as Christ forgave you.

14 Above everything, wear love, which binds everything together in perfect unity.

15 Let God's peace lead in your hearts, which you are called to as one group; and be thankful.

16 Let Christ's message live in you fully, with all wisdom, and teach and warn each other with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing thankfully in your hearts to God.

17 In everything you say or do, do it all for Jesus, thanking God through him.

18 Wives, obey your husbands, as it is right with God.

19 Husbands, love your wives and don't be harsh with them.

20 Kids, listen to your parents in everything, because this makes God happy.

21 Parents, do not make your children angry, so they do not get discouraged.

22 Workers, obey your earthly bosses in everything; not just when they're watching, like people who just want to please others, but with a true heart and respect for God.

23 Do everything with all your heart, as if you're doing it for God, not for people.

24 Understand that from God you will get the reward of what is kept for you in heaven, because you serve Christ.

25 Whoever does wrong will be paid back for their wrong, and everyone is treated the same.
