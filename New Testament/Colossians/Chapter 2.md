1 I want you to know about the big struggle I have for you, for those in Laodicea, and for all who have not met me in person.

2 So that their hearts may be encouraged and united in love, leading to a complete confidence and understanding of God's secret plan, which is Christ himself.

3 In this one, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.

4 I say this so no one will trick you with persuasive words.

5 Even though I am not there in person, I am with you in spirit, happy to see your discipline and firm faith in Christ.

6 Since you accepted Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in Him.

7 Grown deep in him and built up, strong in your faith as you were taught, filled with thankfulness.

8 Be careful that no one misleads you with philosophy and empty lies, following human traditions and worldly principles instead of Christ.

9 In him, the complete nature of God lives in a human form.

10 You are made whole in him, who is the leader of all rulers and authorities.

11 In Christ, you also were spiritually circumcised, not by a physical procedure but by stripping away the sinful nature's control over the body.

12 In baptism, you were buried with him and also raised with him because you believe in God, who brought him back from the dead.

13 You were dead because of your sins and because your flesh was not circumcised, but God made you alive with Christ and forgave all your sins.

14 Erasing the written laws that were against us, which opposed us, and removed them, fixing them to his cross;

15 He disarmed the rulers and authorities, displayed them publicly, and won a victory over them through it.

16 Don't let anyone criticize you about what you eat or drink, or about celebrating religious festivals, observing the new moon, or keeping the Sabbath.

17 These are a preview of what will happen; but the real thing belongs to Christ.

18 Do not let anyone cheat you of your prize by pretending to be humble and worshipping angels, getting involved with things they have never seen, foolishly inflated by their human thinking.

19 Not staying connected to the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.

20 So if you have died with Christ and are free from the world's basic rules, why do you still follow its rules as if you belonged to the world?

21 Do not touch; do not taste; do not handle;

22 These are all destined to be used up and discarded, according to human rules and teachings.

23 These things may seem wise because they require strong devotion, humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they provide no help in controlling selfish desires.
