1 When God knew that the Pharisees heard Jesus was making and baptizing more followers than John,

2 Jesus himself did not baptize, but his followers did.

3 He left Judea and went back to Galilee.

4 He had to go through Samaria.

5 He came to a city in Samaria named Sychar, close to the land Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6 Jacob's well was there. Jesus, tired from his trip, sat on the well. It was about noon.

7 A Samaritan woman came to get water; Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."

8 His followers had gone to the city to buy food.

9 The Samaritan woman asked him, "Why do you, a Jew, ask me for a drink when I am a Samaritan woman? Jews don't associate with Samaritans."

10 Jesus replied to her, "If you knew God's gift and who is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."

11 The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to get water with, and the well is deep. Where can you get that living water?"

12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his children and his animals?

13 Jesus replied to her, "Anyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again."

14 Anyone who drinks the water I give them will never be thirsty again; the water I give them will become a source inside them, flowing up into eternal life.

15 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so I won't be thirsty or have to come here to get water."

16 Jesus said to her, "Go, get your husband, and come back here."

17 The woman replied, "I don't have a husband." Jesus told her, "You are right to say 'I don't have a husband.'"

18 You've had five husbands; and the man you're with now is not your husband. You spoke the truth about that.

19 The woman said to him, "Sir, I see that you are a prophet."

20 Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is where people should worship.

21 Jesus said to her, "Woman, trust me, the time is coming when you won't worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.

22 You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know because salvation comes from the Jews.

23 The time is coming, and it is now, when true worshipers will worship God in spirit and truth: for God looks for such people to worship him.

24 God is a Spirit, and those who worship Him should worship in spirit and truth.

25 The woman said to him, "I know the Messiah is coming, the one called Christ: when he comes, he will explain everything to us."

26 Jesus said to her, "I who am talking to you am he."

27 His disciples arrived and were surprised to see him talking with a woman, but no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"

28 The woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said to the people,

29 Come, see a man who told me everything I've done: could this be the Christ?

30 They left the city and came to him.

31 While this was happening, his followers asked him, "Teacher, please eat."

32 He told them, "I have food to eat that you don't know about."

33 The followers asked each other, "Did anyone bring him something to eat?"

34 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do what God wants, who sent me, and to complete his work."

35 Do not say, "There are still four months until the harvest." I tell you, look at the fields, they are ready to be harvested now.

36 The person who harvests gets paid and collects fruit for eternal life, so that the one who plants and the one who harvests can be happy together.

37 And this saying is true: one person plants, another one harvests.

38 I sent you to harvest where you did not work; others did the work, and you are taking over what they did.

39 Many people from that city believed in Jesus because of what the woman said when she told them, "He told me everything I've done."

40 When the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days.

41 Many more people believed because of what he said.

42 They said to the woman, "We believe now, not just because of what you said. We have heard him ourselves and know that he truly is the Christ, the Savior of the world."

43 Two days later, he left and went to Galilee.

44 Jesus himself said, a prophet is not respected in his own homeland.

45 When he arrived in Galilee, the people there welcomed him because they had seen all he did in Jerusalem during the festival, since they had gone to the festival too.

46 Jesus returned to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned water into wine. A nobleman's son was ill in Capernaum.

47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come and heal his son, because his son was about to die.

48 Jesus said to him, "If you don't see miracles and amazing things, you won't believe."

49 The nobleman said to him, "Sir, please come before my child dies."

50 Jesus said to him, "Go on; your son is alive." The man believed what Jesus had said to him and left.

51 As he was heading down, his servants met him and told him, "Your son is alive."

52 He asked them at what time he started to get better. They told him, "The fever went away yesterday at one in the afternoon."

53 The father realized it was the exact time Jesus told him, "Your son will live." He and his whole family believed.

54 This is the second miracle Jesus performed after he left Judaea for Galilee.
