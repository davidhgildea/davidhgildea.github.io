1 Jesus spoke these words, looked up to heaven, and said, "Father, the time has come; honor your Son, so your Son may honor you."

2 You have given him power over everyone, so he can give eternal life to all you have given to him.

3 Eternal life is to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, who you sent.

4 I have honored you on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.

5 And now, Father, make me glorious with your own glory, the glory I had with you before the world existed.

6 I have shown your name to the people you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have followed your word.

7 Now they understand that everything you have given me comes from you.

8 I gave them the words you gave me; they accepted them and know for sure I came from you, and they believe you sent me.

9 I ask for them: I do not ask for everyone, but for those you have given me; because they are yours.

10 Everything that is mine is yours, and everything that is yours is mine; and I am honored through them.

11 Now I am not in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them with your name, the ones you gave me, so they can be united just as we are.

12 While I was with them, I protected them in your name: I took care of those you gave me, and none were lost, except the one doomed to destruction, so the scripture would come true.

13 I am coming to you now, and I say these things while I am in the world so that they can have my joy completely within them.

14 I have given them your message; and the world has hated them, because they are not part of the world, just as I am not part of the world.

15 I ask not for you to take them from the world, but to protect them from evil.

16 They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.

17 Make them holy by your truth; your message is truth.

18 Just as you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world too.

19 I make myself pure for them so they can be made pure by the truth.

20 I don't only pray for these people, but also for those who will believe in me because of their message.

21 They should all be one; just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, so they should also be one in us. This way, the world will believe you sent me.

22 The honor you gave me, I have given to them, so they can be united just as we are united.

23 I am in them, and you are in me, so that they can be completely one. And so the world can know that you sent me and have loved them as you have loved me.

24 Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, so they can see my glory, the glory you gave me because you loved me before the world began.

25 Good Father, the world has not known you; but I have known you, and these know that you sent me.

26 I have told them your name and will continue to, so that the love you have for me may be in them, and I in them.
