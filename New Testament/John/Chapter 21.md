1 After these events, Jesus appeared again to his followers by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself like this.

2 Simon Peter, Thomas also known as Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two more disciples were all together.

3 Simon Peter tells them, "I'm going fishing." They respond, "We'll come with you." So they leave, get on a boat right away, and that night they don't catch anything.

4 When morning came, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus.

5 Jesus asked them, "Children, do you have any food?" They replied, "No."

6 He told them, "Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you will catch fish." They did so, and they couldn't pull it in because there were so many fish.

7 So the disciple Jesus loved told Peter, "It's the Lord." When Simon Peter heard it was the Lord, he put on his fishing jacket (because he was not wearing clothes) and jumped into the water.

8 The other followers arrived in a small boat; they were not far from shore, about two hundred cubits away, towing the net full of fish.

9 As soon as they reached the shore, they saw a coal fire with fish on it, and bread.

10 Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you just caught."

11 Simon Peter pulled the net full of large fish onto the shore, 153 in total, and even though there were so many, the net did not tear.

12 Jesus said to them, "Come and eat." And none of the friends dared to ask him, "Who are you?" knowing it was God.

13 Jesus came, took bread, gave it to them, and also gave them fish.

14 This is now the third time Jesus showed himself to his followers after he rose from the dead.

15 After they ate, Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than these?" He answered, "Yes, God; you know that I love you." Jesus told him, "Take care of my lambs."

16 He asked him a second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord; you know I love you." He said to him, "Take care of my sheep."

17 He asked him for the third time, "Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me?" Peter felt sad because he asked him three times, "Do you love me?" And he told him, "God, you know everything; you know I love you." Jesus told him, "Take care of my sheep."

18 I tell you the truth, when you were young, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and take you where you don't want to go.

19 He said this to show the kind of death by which he would honor God. After saying this, he told him, "Follow me."

20 Then Peter turned around and saw the disciple Jesus loved following them. This was the same one who had been close to Jesus at the meal and had asked, "Lord, who will betray you?"

21 Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, "Master, what will this man do?"

22 Jesus said to him, "If I want him to stay until I come back, what does that matter to you? You follow me."

23 This message spread among the followers: they thought that disciple would not die. But Jesus didn't say he wouldn't die; he said, "If I want him to remain until I return, what concern is that of yours?"

24 This is the follower who tells about these events and wrote them down: and we are sure that what he says is true.

25 Jesus did many other things too. If someone wrote them all down, I think the whole world couldn't hold all the books that would be written. Amen.
