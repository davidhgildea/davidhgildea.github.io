1 Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him.

2 The soldiers twisted a thorn crown, put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple robe.

3 They said, "Hello, King of the Jews!" and hit him with their hands.

4 Pilate came out again and said to them, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to show that I find no fault in him."

5 Jesus came out wearing a crown of thorns and a purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Look at the man!"

6 So when the religious leaders and their helpers saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate told them, "You take him and crucify him, because I don't find him guilty."

7 The Jews told him, "We have a law, and according to our law, he should die because he claimed to be God's Son."

8 When Pilate heard this, he became even more afraid.

9 He went back into the court and asked Jesus, "Where do you come from?" But Jesus did not answer him.

10 Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you talk to me? Don't you know that I have the power to crucify you and the power to set you free?"

11 Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it weren't given to you from above. So the one who handed me over to you has a bigger sin."

12 From then on, Pilate tried to set him free, but the Jews shouted, "If you let this man go, you're not loyal to Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king is against Caesar."

13 When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge's bench at a place called the Pavement, which in Hebrew is Gabbatha.

14 It was the time to get ready for the Passover, about six in the morning, when he said to the Jewish people, "Look, here is your King!"

15 But they shouted, "Take him away, take him away, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Should I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."

16 So he handed Jesus over to them to be crucified. They took Jesus and led him away.

17 He carried his cross to a place known as Skull Hill, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.

18 They crucified him there with two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.

19 Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross. It said, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."

20 Many of the Jewish people read this title because the place where Jesus was crucified was close to the city. It was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.

21 The Jewish leaders told Pilate, "Don't write 'The King of the Jews,' but write that he claimed, 'I am King of the Jews.'"

22 Pilate answered, "What I've written, I've written."

23 After the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, giving each soldier a part. They also took his coat, which was seamless and woven in one piece from top to bottom.

24 So they said to each other, "Let's not tear it. Let's throw dice to see who gets it." This was to fulfill what was written: "They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment." And that's what the soldiers did.

25 Near Jesus' cross stood his mother, her sister, Mary married to Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

26 When Jesus saw his mother and his close friend standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Woman, here is your son!"

27 Then he said to the follower, "Here is your mother!" And from that time, the follower took her into his home.

28 After this, Jesus, knowing that everything was done and the scripture would be complete, said, "I am thirsty."

29 A jar full of sour wine was there; they soaked a sponge in the sour wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and held it up to his mouth.

30 When Jesus took the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." Then he bowed his head and passed away.

31 So the Jewish leaders, because it was the day to get ready, and since they did not want bodies to stay on the crosses during the Sabbath (which was a special day), asked Pilate to have their legs broken and the bodies removed.

32 Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and the other who was crucified with him.

33 But when they reached Jesus and saw he was already dead, they did not break his legs.

34 A soldier stabbed his side with a spear, and blood and water flowed out right away.

35 The one who saw it has testified, and his testimony is true: and he knows he's telling the truth, so you may believe.

36 These things happened so that what was written would come true: None of his bones will be broken.

37 Another part of the Bible says, "They will look at the one they stabbed."

38 After this, Joseph from Arimathaea, who followed Jesus but kept it secret because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders, asked Pilate for permission to take Jesus's body. Pilate allowed it, so he came and took Jesus's body away.

39 Nicodemus, who first visited Jesus at night, also came, bringing about a hundred pounds of a mix of myrrh and aloes.

40 They took Jesus' body and wrapped it in linen with spices, as is the Jewish way to bury.

41 Near where he was crucified was a garden, and in it, a new tomb where no one had been laid before.

42 They placed Jesus there because it was the Jewish day of preparation, and the tomb was close by.
