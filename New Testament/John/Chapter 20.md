1 Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb.

2 She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple, who Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away God from the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him."

3 Peter and another disciple went out and came to the tomb.

4 They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first.

5 He bent over, looked inside, and saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.

6 Simon Peter arrived later, went into the tomb, and saw the linen wrappings lying there.

7 The cloth that had been on his head wasn't lying with the other linen, but was folded up by itself separately.

8 The other disciple who arrived first at the tomb also went inside, saw, and believed.

9 They did not yet understand the Scripture that said he had to rise from the dead.

10 The followers then went back to their own homes.

11 Mary stood outside the tomb crying, and as she cried, she bent over to look inside the tomb.

12 She sees two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where Jesus's body had been.

13 They ask her, "Woman, why are you crying?" She answers them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have put him."

14 After saying this, she turned around, saw Jesus standing there, but did not recognize it was Jesus.

15 Jesus asked her, "Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have taken him away, tell me where you've put him and I will get him."

16 Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned around, and said to him, "Teacher."

17 Jesus said to her, "Don't touch me, because I haven't gone up to my Father yet. But go to my brothers and tell them, 'I am going up to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.'"

18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen God, and that he had spoken these things to her.

19 On that evening, which was the first day of the week, the disciples were together with the doors closed because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Then, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you."

20 After saying this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were happy when they saw God.

21 Jesus said to them again, "Peace to you. Just as my Father sent me, I send you."

22 After he said this, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."

23 If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.

24 Thomas, who was one of the twelve disciples and also called Didymus, wasn't there when Jesus appeared.

25 The other followers told him, "We have seen God." But he replied, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my finger where the nails were, and place my hand in his side, I won't believe."

26 Eight days later, Jesus's followers were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace to you."

27 He said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and look at my hands. Put your hand into my side. Stop doubting and believe."

28 Thomas replied to him, "My Lord and my God."

29 Jesus said to him, "Thomas, because you have seen me, you believe. Happy are those who have not seen and still believe."

30 Jesus did many other miracles in front of his disciples that are not recorded in this book.

31 These are written so you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, God's Son, and by believing, you may have life in his name.
