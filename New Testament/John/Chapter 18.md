1 After Jesus said these things, he and his disciples crossed the Cedron stream and went into a garden there.

2 Judas, who betrayed Jesus, knew the place because Jesus often went there with his followers.

3 Judas, after getting a group of men and leaders from the top priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.

4 Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who are you looking for?"

5 They replied to him, "Jesus from Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am the one." Judas, who betrayed him, was also standing with them.

6 As soon as he told them, "I am he," they stepped back and fell to the ground.

7 He asked them again, "Who are you looking for?" They answered, "Jesus of Nazareth."

8 Jesus answered, "I have told you that I am the one you're looking for. So if you want me, let these others go."

9 This was to fulfill what he said, "I have not lost any of those you gave me."

10 Simon Peter, with a sword, pulled it out, hit the high priest's helper, and cut off his right ear. The helper's name was Malchus.

11 Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword back in its place. Shouldn't I drink the cup that my Father has given me?"

12 The group, their leader, and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus and tied him up.

13 They took him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.

14 Caiaphas was the one who advised the Jews that it was better for one man to die for the people.

15 Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. The other disciple knew the high priest, so he went with Jesus into the high priest's house.

16 Peter stayed outside by the door. Then the other disciple, who the high priest knew, went out, talked to the woman guarding the door, and brought Peter inside.

17 Then the girl watching the door said to Peter, "Aren't you one of this man's followers?" He answered, "No, I'm not."

18 The servants and guards were standing there, having made a coal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter also stood with them and warmed himself.

19 The high priest then asked Jesus about his followers and his teaching.

20 Jesus replied, "I spoke clearly to everyone; I always taught in the synagogues and at the temple where the Jews gather; I never said anything in secret."

21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them: they know what I said.

22 After he said this, one of the officers standing there hit Jesus with his hand, asking, "Do you talk back to the high priest like that?"

23 Jesus replied, "If I said something wrong, show what it was. But if I spoke rightly, why did you hit me?"

24 Annas had sent him tied up to Caiaphas, the high priest.

25 Simon Peter stood warming himself. They asked him, "Aren't you one of his followers?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."

26 A servant of the high priest, who was related to the man whose ear Peter cut off, asked, "Didn't I see you in the garden with him?"

27 Peter denied it once more, and right then a rooster crowed.

28 They took Jesus from Caiaphas to the courthouse early in the morning. They didn't go inside the courthouse to avoid becoming unclean and to be able to eat the Passover meal.

29 Pilate went out to them and asked, "What charges are you making against this man?"

30 They replied and said to him, "If he were not a criminal, we wouldn't have handed him over to you."

31 Pilate told them, "Take him and judge him by your own law." But the Jews answered, "We are not allowed to put anyone to death."

32 This was to fulfill what Jesus had said, showing how he would die.

33 Pilate went back into the courthouse, called Jesus, and asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"

34 Jesus answered, "Are you asking this on your own, or did others talk to you about me?"

35 Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own people and the religious leaders handed you over to me. What have you done?"

36 Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom belonged to this world, my helpers would fight to prevent me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders. But my kingdom is not from here."

37 Pilate asked him, "So you are a king?" Jesus replied, "You say I am a king. I was born for this purpose, and I came into the world to tell the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice."

38 Pilate asked him, "What is truth?" After saying this, he went out to the Jews and said, "I find no fault in him at all."

39 You have a tradition that I let one prisoner go during Passover. Do you want me to release the King of the Jews to you?

40 They all shouted again, "Not this man, but Barabbas." Barabbas was a thief.
