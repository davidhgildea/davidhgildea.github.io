1 As Jesus walked by, he saw a man who was born blind.

2 His followers asked him, "Teacher, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born without sight?"

3 Jesus said, "This man and his parents did not sin. It's so that God's work can be shown in him."

4 I need to do the tasks of the one who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.

5 As long as I am in the world, I am the world's light.

6 After saying this, he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and put it on the blind man's eyes.

7 He told him, "Go wash in the pool of Siloam (which means 'Sent')." So he went, washed, and came back able to see.

8 So the neighbors and those who had seen him before when he was blind asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"

9 Some said, "This is him"; others said, "He looks like him"; but he himself said, "I am the one."

10 So they asked him, "How were your eyes opened?"

11 He replied, "A man named Jesus put mud on my eyes and told me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.' So I went, washed, and then I could see."

12 They asked him, "Where is he?" He answered, "I don't know."

13 They took the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.

14 It was the Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened the man's eyes.

15 The Pharisees asked him again how he got his sight back. He told them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed it off, and now I can see."

16 Some Pharisees said, "This man is not from God because he doesn't keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such amazing things?" So they disagreed among themselves.

17 They asked the blind man again, "What do you think about him, since he healed your eyes?" He replied, "He is a prophet."

18 The Jews didn't believe that he had been blind and could now see until they asked his parents.

19 They asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How can he see now?"

20 His parents answered, "We know this is our son and that he was born unable to see."

21 We don't know how he can now see, or who healed his eyes. He's an adult; ask him, and he will answer for himself.

22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. The leaders had decided that if anyone said he was the Christ, they would be banned from the synagogue.

23 So his parents said, "He's old enough; ask him."

24 They called the man who had been blind again, and told him, "Praise God: we know this man is a sinner."

25 He replied, "I don't know if he is a sinner; all I know is I was blind, and now I can see."

26 They asked him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"

27 He told them, "I already told you, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to be his followers?"

28 They insulted him and said, "You are his follower; but we follow Moses."

29 We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don't know where this man comes from.

30 The man replied, "It's amazing that you don't know where he comes from, yet he healed my eyes."

31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone worships God and does what He wants, God listens to him.

32 No one has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a person born blind since the world began.

33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.

34 They replied to him, "You were completely born in sin, and now you try to teach us?" So they threw him out.

35 Jesus knew they threw him out; when he found him, he asked, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"

36 He replied, "Who is he, God, so that I might believe in him?"

37 Jesus said to him, "You have seen him, and he is the one speaking with you."

38 He said, "God, I believe." And he honored him.

39 Jesus said, "I have come to bring judgment to the world so that those who cannot see may see, and those who can see may become blind."

40 Some Pharisees with him heard this and asked, "Are we also blind?"

41 Jesus told them, "If you were blind, you wouldn't be guilty of sin. But now you claim, 'We can see,' so your sin stays with you."
