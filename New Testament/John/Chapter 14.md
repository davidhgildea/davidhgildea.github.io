1 Don't be worried in your heart; you trust in God, trust also in me.

2 In my Father's house, there are many homes. If it wasn't true, I would have told you. I am going to get a place ready for you.

3 If I go and get a place ready for you, I will come back and take you with me; so you can be where I am too.

4 You know where I'm going and you know the way.

5 Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going; how can we know the way?"

6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."

7 If you had known me, you would have known my Father too. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.

8 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."

9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you for so long, and you still don't know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen God; so why do you say, 'Show us God'?"

10 Don't you believe that I am in God, and God is in me? The words I tell you are not just from me: it's God living in me who does the works.

11 Trust that I am in God, and God is in me; if not, trust because of the things I have done.

12 Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I do, and they will do even greater works, because I am going to my Father.

13 Whatever you ask for in my name, I will do it so that the Father may be honored through the Son.

14 If you ask for anything in my name, I will do it.

15 If you love me, follow my commands.

16 I will ask God, and he will give you another Helper to be with you always.

17 The Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept because it does not see or know him: but you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.

18 I will not leave you alone: I will come to you.

19 Soon, the world will not see me; but you will see me. Because I am alive, you will live too.

20 On that day, you will understand that I am with my Father, and you are with me, and I am with you.

21 The one who has my commands and follows them truly loves me; and the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and show myself to him.

22 Judas, not Iscariot, asked him, "Lord, how will you show yourself to us but not to the world?"

23 Jesus replied, "If someone loves me, he will follow my teachings. Then my Father will love him, and we will come to him and live with him."

24 Anyone who doesn't love me doesn't follow my teachings. The message you hear isn't mine, but it comes from the Father who sent me.

25 I have said these things to you while I am still with you.

26 The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom God will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all I have told you.

27 I leave you peace, my peace I give you. Not the way the world does, do I give to you. Don't let your heart be troubled or afraid.

28 You have heard me say I will leave and come back to you. If you loved me, you would be happy because I am going to the Father, who is greater than me.

29 I have told you beforehand so that when it happens, you may believe.

30 From now on, I won't talk much with you because the ruler of this world is coming, and he has no power over me.

31 I want the world to know I love God; I follow His commands. Let's get up and go.
