1 After this, Jesus stayed in Galilee because he did not want to be in Judea where the Jewish leaders wanted to kill him.

2 The Jewish festival of shelters was coming soon.

3 His brothers told him, "Leave this place and go to Judea, so your followers can see what you are doing."

4 No one does things secretly if they want to be known publicly. If you do these things, let everyone see you.

5 His brothers did not believe in him.

6 Then Jesus told them, "My time has not come yet, but your time is always here."

7 The world cannot hate you; but it hates me because I say that its actions are evil.

8 Go to this festival; I am not going yet because my time has not fully come.

9 After he spoke to them, he stayed in Galilee.

10 After his brothers left, he also went to the festival, not publicly, but in secret.

11 During the festival, the Jewish people looked for him and asked, "Where is he?"

12 Many people whispered about him: some said, "He is good," while others said, "No, he tricks the people."

13 However, no one talked about him publicly because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders.

14 During the festival, Jesus went to the temple and taught.

15 The Jews were amazed and asked, "How does this man know so much when he has never been taught?"

16 Jesus told them, "My teaching is not my own, but belongs to the one who sent me."

17 If anyone chooses to do God's will, they will understand the teaching and know whether it comes from God or if I am speaking on my own.

18 Someone who talks about themselves wants their own praise. But if a person seeks to honor the one who sent them, they are true, and there's nothing wrong in them.

19 Didn't Moses give you the law, but none of you follow it? Why do you want to kill me?

20 The people replied, "You are crazy: who is trying to kill you?"

21 Jesus replied to them, "I did one thing, and you are all amazed."

22 Moses gave you the practice of circumcision; (though it didn't start with Moses, but with the ancestors;) and you even circumcise a man on the Sabbath day.

23 If a man is circumcised on the Sabbath so the law of Moses isn't broken, why are you mad at me for healing a man completely on the Sabbath?

24 Do not judge by how things look, but judge with fair judgment.

25 Some people from Jerusalem asked, "Isn't this the man they want to kill?"

26 Look, he speaks openly, and no one says anything to him. Do the leaders really know that he is the Christ?

27 We know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.

28 Jesus shouted in the temple as he was teaching, saying, "You all know me, and you know where I'm from. I didn't come on my own, but the one who sent me is real, and you don't know him.

29 I know him because I come from him, and he sent me.

30 They tried to seize him, but no one touched him because his time had not yet come.

31 Many people believed in him and asked, "When the Messiah comes, will he perform more miracles than this man has?"

32 The Pharisees heard the people whispering these things about him; so the Pharisees and the head priests sent guards to arrest him.

33 Jesus said to them, "I will be with you a little longer, then I will go to the one who sent me."

34 You will look for me but won't find me; and you can't go where I am.

35 Then the Jews said to each other, "Where is he planning to go that we can't find him? Will he go to the scattered Jews among the non-Jews and teach the non-Jews?"

36 What does he mean by saying, "You will look for me, but you won't find me: and you can't come where I am"?

37 On the final day, the big feast day, Jesus stood up and shouted, "If anyone is thirsty, come to me and drink."

38 Whoever believes in me, just as the scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within them.

39 He said this about the Spirit, which believers in him would receive: The Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.

40 So when the people heard this, many said, "Truly, this is the Prophet."

41 Some people said, "This is the Christ." But others asked, "Does the Christ come from Galilee?"

42 Doesn't the scripture say that Christ will come from David's family, and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?

43 People were divided because of him.

44 Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one touched him.

45 The officers went to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they asked, "Why didn't you bring him?"

46 The officers replied, "No one ever spoke like this person."

47 The Pharisees replied, "Have you been tricked too?"

48 Have any leaders or Pharisees believed in him?

49 But these people who do not know the law are cursed.

50 Nicodemus, who had visited Jesus at night and was one of the group, said to them.

51 Does our law judge anyone before it hears him and knows what he is doing?

52 They replied to him, "Are you from Galilee too? Look and see: no prophet comes from Galilee."

53 Everyone went to their own home.
