1 Before the Passover feast, when Jesus realized his time had come to leave this world and go to the Father, he showed endless love for his followers who were in the world.

2 After dinner, the devil had already persuaded Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Jesus.

3 Jesus knew that God had given him power over everything, and that he had come from God and was going back to God.

4 He got up from dinner, took off his clothes, and wrapped a towel around himself.

5 Then he poured water into a basin and started to wash his followers' feet, drying them with the towel he was wearing.

6 Then he came to Simon Peter, and Peter asked him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"

7 Jesus answered him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand later."

8 Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet." Jesus replied, "If I do not wash you, you have no share with me."

9 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not just my feet, but also my hands and my head."

10 Jesus said to him, "Someone who has bathed only needs to wash their feet to be completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you."

11 He knew who would betray him; that is why he said, "Not all of you are clean."

12 After he washed your feet, put on his clothes, and sat down again, he asked them, "Do you understand what I have done for you?"

13 You call me Teacher and God, and you are right, because that's what I am.

14 If I, your leader and teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash each other's feet.

15 I have set an example for you, so you should do as I have done to you.

16 Truly, truly, I tell you, a servant is not more important than his master; nor is the one who is sent more important than the one who sent him.

17 If you know these things, you will be happy if you do them.

18 I am not talking about all of you: I know the ones I picked: but so the scripture comes true, the one who shares my bread has turned against me.

19 I tell you now, before it happens, so when it does happen, you will believe that I am the one.

20 Truly, truly, I tell you, anyone who welcomes the person I send welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.

21 After Jesus said this, he felt very upset and declared, "Truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me."

22 The followers looked at each other, not sure who he was talking about.

23 One disciple, who Jesus loved, was resting on Jesus' chest.

24 Simon Peter motioned to him to ask which one Jesus meant.

25 He, resting on Jesus' chest, asked him, "Master, who is it?"

26 Jesus answered, "The one I give the piece of bread to after I dip it." After dipping the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, Simon's son.

27 After he took the piece of bread, Satan came into him. Then Jesus told him, "Do what you're going to do, do it fast."

28 No one at the table knew why he said this to him.

29 Some thought Jesus told Judas, who kept the money, to buy what was needed for the festival or give money to the poor.

30 After taking the piece of food, he quickly left, and it was night.

31 So when he left, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is honored, and God is honored in him."

32 If God is honored through him, God will honor him in return, and will do it soon.

33 Kids, I'll be with you for a little longer. You will look for me, and like I told the Jewish people, where I'm going, you can't come; I'm telling you this now too.

34 I give you a new command: love each other just as I have loved you, so you also should love each other.

35 Everyone will know you are my followers if you love each other.

36 Simon Peter asked him, "Where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow me later."

37 Peter said to him, "God, why can't I follow you now? I will give up my life for you."

38 Jesus replied, "Are you ready to give up your life for me? Truly, I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
