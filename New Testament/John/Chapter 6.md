1 After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee, also called the Sea of Tiberias.

2 Many people followed him because they saw the amazing things he did for the sick.

3 Jesus went up a mountain and sat there with his followers.

4 The Passover, a Jewish celebration, was near.

5 When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, he asked Philip, "Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?"

6 He said this to test him, because he already knew what he was going to do.

7 Philip told him, "Even two hundred coins worth of bread wouldn't be enough for them so that each person can have a small piece."

8 One of Jesus' followers, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said to him,

9 Here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many people?

10 Jesus said, "Have the men sit down." There was a lot of grass there. So the men sat down, about five thousand in total.

11 Jesus took the bread, thanked God, gave it to his disciples, and they gave it to the seated people. They did the same with the fish, giving as much as everyone wanted.

12 When they had enough to eat, he told his disciples, "Pick up the leftover pieces so nothing is wasted."

13 So they collected and filled twelve baskets with leftover pieces of the five barley breads after everyone had eaten.

14 When the men saw the miracle Jesus performed, they said, "Truly, this is the prophet who was to come into the world."

15 When Jesus knew they wanted to force him to be their king, he went away to a mountain by himself.

16 When evening came, his followers went to the sea.

17 They got into a boat and sailed across the lake to Capernaum. It was night, and Jesus had not yet joined them.

18 The sea got rough because a strong wind was blowing.

19 After they had rowed about five or six kilometers, they saw Jesus walking on the water, coming near the boat; and they were scared.

20 He said to them, "It's me; don't be scared."

21 They happily let him into the boat, and right away the boat reached the shore where they were going.

22 The next day, when the people on the other side of the sea noticed that there was no other boat except the one his disciples had gotten into, and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples in the boat but his disciples had left by themselves;

23 But other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate bread after God had given thanks.

24 When the people saw that Jesus and his followers were not there, they took boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.

25 When they found him across the sea, they asked him, "Teacher, when did you get here?"

26 Jesus replied, "Truly, truly, I tell you, you look for me not because you saw the miracles but because you ate the bread and were satisfied."

27 Work not for food that spoils, but for food that lasts forever, which the Son of Man will give you. For God has confirmed his authority.

28 They asked him, "What should we do to do God's work?"

29 Jesus answered them, "The work God wants is that you believe in the one He has sent."

30 They therefore said to him, "What sign do you show us, so we can see and believe you? What do you do?"

31 Our ancestors ate manna in the desert; it is said, God gave them bread from heaven to eat.

32 Jesus told them, "Truly, I tell you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the real bread from heaven."

33 God's bread is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.

34 Then they said to him, "Sir, always give us this bread."

35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty."

36 I told you that you have seen me but you do not believe.

37 Everyone the Father gives to me will come to me; and I will never reject anyone who comes to me.

38 I came from heaven not to do what I want, but to do what God, who sent me, wants.

39 God wants me to lose nothing he has given me, but to bring it back to life on the last day.

40 God wants that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him will have eternal life, and I will bring him back to life on the final day.

41 The Jews complained about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."

42 They asked, "Isn't this Jesus, Joseph's son, who we know his parents? How can he say, 'I came from heaven'?"

43 Jesus answered them, "Do not complain to each other."

44 No one can come to me unless God who sent me draws them: and I will lift them up on the last day.

45 The prophets wrote, 'Everyone will be taught by God.' So everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.

46 No one has seen the Father, except the one from God; he has seen the Father.

47 Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes in me has eternal life.

48 I am the bread of life.

49 Your ancestors ate manna in the desert, and they died.

50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that a person can eat it and not die.

51 I am the bread of life that came from heaven; if anyone eats this bread, they will live forever; and the bread I will give is my body, which I will give to save the world.

52 The Jews argued with each other, asking, "How can this man offer us his flesh to eat?"

53 Jesus told them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the Son of man's flesh and drink his blood, you do not have life in you."

54 Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day.

55 My body is real food, and my blood is real drink.

56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I live in them.

57 The living God sent me, and I live because of God: just as he who eats my flesh will live because of me.

58 This is the bread that came down from heaven; it's not like the manna your ancestors ate and then died. Whoever eats this bread will live forever.

59 He said these things while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.

60 Many of his followers, when they heard this, said, "This teaching is difficult; who can accept it?"

61 When Jesus realized that his followers were complaining about it, he asked them, "Does this upset you?"

62 What if you see the Son of Man go up to where he was before?

63 The Spirit gives life; the body gives nothing of value: the words I tell you are Spirit and they are life.

64 But some of you do not believe. Jesus knew from the start who did not believe and who would betray him.

65 He said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless my Father allows it."

66 From then on, many of his followers left and no longer walked with him.

67 Jesus then asked the twelve, "Do you want to leave as well?"

68 Simon Peter replied, "Master, who else can we turn to? You have the message of everlasting life."

69 We believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

70 Jesus replied, "Didn't I pick you twelve, and isn't one of you evil?"

71 He spoke about Judas Iscariot, Simon's son because he was the one who would betray him, even though he was one of the twelve.
