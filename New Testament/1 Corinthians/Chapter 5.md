1 People often say that sexual immorality is happening among you, the kind not even non-believers talk about, like someone living with his stepmother.

2 You have become arrogant instead of mourning, so that the one who did this should be removed from among you.

3 Although I am not there in person, I am with you in spirit and have already made my decision about the person who did this.

4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you gather and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,

5 To hand someone over to Satan to destroy their flesh so that their spirit can be saved on the day of Jesus.

6 Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?

7 Get rid of the old yeast, so you can be a fresh batch of dough, since you are without yeast. Just as Christ, our Passover lamb, has been offered for us.

8 Let's celebrate the festival not with old yeast or with yeast of evil and badness, but with bread without yeast that is pure and true.

9 I wrote to you in a letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.

10 Don't completely avoid people in this world who sin sexually, are greedy, cheat others, or worship idols; if you did, you would have to leave this world.

11 I have told you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother but is sexually immoral, greedy, worships idols, insults others, drinks too much, or cheats people. Do not even eat with such a person.

12 Why should I judge those outside? Don't you judge those inside?

13 God judges those who are outside. So remove the evil person from among you.
