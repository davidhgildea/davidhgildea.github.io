1 About the money being gathered for God's people, do as I told the churches in Galatia to do.

2 On the first day of the week, each of you should set aside some money in keeping with how much God has blessed you, so that we won't need to collect money when I arrive.

3 When I arrive, whoever you choose and recommend in your letters, I will send them to take your gift to Jerusalem.

4 If it's right that I go too, they will go with me.

5 I will come to you after I travel through Macedonia because I am going through Macedonia.

6 I might stay and spend the winter with you, so you can help me continue my trip wherever I go.

7 I won't visit you now as I travel; but I hope to stay with you for a bit, if God allows.

8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost.

9 A big and powerful opportunity has come to me, and there are many opponents.

10 If Timothy comes, make sure he can be with you without fear, because he is doing God's work, just like I am.

11 Don't let anyone look down on him. Send him off in peace so he can come to me, because I am expecting him with the others.

12 About our friend Apollos, I really wanted him to visit you with the others, but he did not want to come right now. He will come when he has a good time.

13 Stay alert, stand firm in your belief, be brave and strong.

14 Do everything with love.

15 I ask you, friends, you know Stephanas's family was the first to believe in Achaia, and they have dedicated themselves to serving God's people.

16 Submit to such people, and to everyone who works and labors with us.

17 I am happy Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came because they have provided what you could not.

18 They have uplifted my spirit and yours; so recognize those like them.

19 The churches in Asia send their greetings to you. Aquila and Priscilla send a warm greeting in God, along with the church that meets in their home.

20 All the friends send their greetings. Greet each other with a sacred kiss.

21 I, Paul, greet you with my own hand.

22 If someone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let that person be cursed.

23 May the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

24 My love is with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
