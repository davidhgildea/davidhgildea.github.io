1 If I speak in human and angel languages but don't have love, I am only a loud horn or a clanging cymbal.

2 Even if I can prophesy, understand all secrets, know everything, and have enough faith to move mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.

3 Even if I give away everything I own to help the poor, and even if I sacrifice my body, but do not have love, it does me no good.

4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy; love does not boast and is not proud.

5 Doesn't act improperly, doesn't seek its own benefit, isn't easily angered, doesn't think of doing wrong.

6 Does not delight in wrong, but celebrates the truth.

7 Bears everything, believes everything, hopes for everything, endures everything.

8 Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will stop; if there are languages, they will end; if there is knowledge, it will go away.

9 We know some things and we tell about the future as much as we know.

10 When the perfect thing comes, the imperfect things will disappear.

11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I grew up, I stopped doing childish things.

12 Now we see unclearly, as in a mirror; but then we will see clearly, face to face. Now I know only a little; but then I will fully understand, just as I am fully understood.

13 Now faith, hope, and love remain, these three; but the most important of these is love.
