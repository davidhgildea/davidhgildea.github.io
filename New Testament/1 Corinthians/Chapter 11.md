1 Follow me, just as I follow Christ.

2 I am happy, friends, that you remember me in everything and follow the teachings just as I gave them to you.

3 I want you to understand that Christ leads every man, the man leads the woman, and God leads Christ.

4 Every man who prays or speaks God's words with his head covered shames his head.

5 Every woman who prays or speaks God's messages with her head not covered dishonors her head; it's just like if she had her head shaved.

6 If a woman does not wear a covering, she should cut her hair. But if it is shameful for a woman to have short hair or be shaved, she should cover her head.

7 A man should not cover his head because he is made in God's image and reflects God's glory. But a woman reflects a man's glory.

8 The man does not come from the woman, but the woman comes from the man.

9 The man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.

10 For this reason, a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.

11 Still, neither is man complete without woman, nor woman without man, in God.

12 Just as a woman comes from a man, so does a man come through a woman; but everything comes from God.

13 Think for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

14 Doesn't nature itself show you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him?

15 If a woman has long hair, it is her pride, because her hair is given to her as a covering.

16 If anyone likes to argue, we don't have that habit, and neither do God's churches.

17 In telling you this, I do not praise you, because when you meet, it's not for the good but for the bad.

18 First, when you meet as a church, I've heard there are splits among you, and I believe it somewhat.

19 There must also be false beliefs among you, so that those who are true can be clearly seen.

20 When you meet together in one place, it is not to eat God's supper.

21 When they eat, some people go first and take their own meal, leaving others hungry while some have too much to drink.

22 Do you not have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you look down on God's church and embarrass those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I commend you for this? I do not commend you.

23 I got from God what I also passed on to you: on the night Jesus was betrayed, he took bread.

24 After thanking God, he broke the bread and said, "Take and eat; this is my body given for you. Do this to remember me."

25 In the same way, he took the cup after supper and said, "This cup is the new agreement in my blood; do this whenever you drink it, to remember me."

26 Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the death of God until he comes.

27 So anyone who eats this bread and drinks this cup of God in a wrong way will be guilty of sinning against God's body and blood.

28 A person should check themselves before they eat the bread and drink from the cup.

29 Anyone who eats and drinks without respecting the body of God eats and drinks judgment on themselves.

30 Because of this, many of you are weak and ill, and a number have died.

31 If we judge ourselves, we won't be judged by others.

32 When God corrects us, it's so we won't be punished along with the world.

33 So, my friends, when you gather to eat, wait for each other.

34 If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home so that when you meet, it doesn't lead to judgment. I will take care of the other matters when I arrive.
