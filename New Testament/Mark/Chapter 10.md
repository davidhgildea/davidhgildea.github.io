1 He got up from there and went to the region of Judea across the Jordan. People came to him again, and as usual, he taught them.

2 The Pharisees went to him and asked, "Is it okay for a man to divorce his wife?" to test him.

3 He replied and asked them, "What did Moses tell you to do?"

4 They said, Moses allowed to write a divorce paper, and to send her away.

5 Jesus answered them, "Because your hearts were hard, he gave you this rule."

6 Since the start of creation, God made them as man and woman.

7 A man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife.

8 The two will become one body, so they are not two anymore, but one body.

9 So what God has united, let no one separate.

10 In the house, his disciples questioned him once more about that topic.

11 He tells them, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is unfaithful to her."

12 If a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she cheats on him.

13 People brought little children to Jesus so he could touch them. But his followers scolded those who brought the children.

14 But when Jesus saw this, he was very upset and said to them, "Let the children come to me, do not stop them: for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."

15 Truly I tell you, anyone who doesn't accept the kingdom of God like a small child will not get in.

16 He picked them up, touched them with his hands, and gave them his blessing.

17 As he started on his way, someone ran up, knelt before him, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to get eternal life?"

18 Jesus asked him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone."

19 You know the commands: Do not cheat on your partner, do not kill, do not steal, do not lie, do not cheat others, respect your father and mother.

20 He replied, "Teacher, I have followed all these since I was young."

21 Jesus looked at him with love and said, "You're missing one thing: go, sell everything you own, and give the money to the poor. Then you will have riches in heaven. Come, carry the cross, and follow me."

22 He felt sad when he heard this and left feeling upset because he owned a lot.

23 Jesus looked around and said to his followers, "How difficult it is for those with wealth to enter God's kingdom!"

24 The followers were amazed at his words. But Jesus spoke again, and said to them, "Children, how difficult it is for those who rely on their wealth to get into God's kingdom!"

25 It's simpler for a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom.

26 They were extremely surprised and asked each other, "Then who can be saved?"

27 Jesus looked at them and said, "For people it's impossible, but not for God; with God all things are possible."

28 Then Peter started to say to him, "Look, we have left everything and followed you."

29 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, no one who has left home, brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, or fields for me and the good news.

30 He will get a hundred times more now in this time: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, along with troubles; and in the future world, eternal life.

31 Many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.

32 They were traveling to Jerusalem. Jesus was leading them. They were amazed and scared as they followed him. He gathered the twelve disciples and started to explain what would happen to him.

33 Look, we are going to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law; they will find him guilty of death and will hand him over to the foreigners.

34 They will make fun of him, whip him, spit on him, and kill him. But on the third day, he will come back to life.

35 James and John, Zebedee's sons, came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want you to do whatever we ask."

36 He asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?"

37 They asked him, "Let us sit with you in your glory, one on your right side and the other on your left side."

38 But Jesus told them, You don't understand what you're asking. Can you drink the cup I drink? And be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?

39 They said to him, "We can." And Jesus told them, "You will truly drink the cup I drink from; and you will be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with."

40 But to sit at my right or left side isn't for me to give; it will be given to those it's ready for.

41 When the ten other disciples heard this, they became very upset with James and John.

42 Jesus called them over and said, "You know that the ones who are considered rulers over the people have power over them, and the important people have authority over them."

43 However, among you it should be different: whoever wants to be important must serve you.

44 Anyone who wants to be the most important among you must serve everyone.

45 Even the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life to save many people.

46 They arrived at Jericho. As he was leaving Jericho with his followers and many people, a blind man named Bartimaeus, Timaeus's son, was sitting by the road asking for money.

47 When he heard it was Jesus from Nazareth, he started shouting, "Jesus, son of David, please have mercy on me."

48 Many people told him to be quiet, but he shouted even louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me."

49 Jesus stopped and told them to call the man. They called the blind man, saying, "Cheer up, get up; he is calling you."

50 He threw off his coat, got up, and went to Jesus.

51 Jesus answered, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said, "I want to see again."

52 Jesus said to him, "Go; your faith has healed you." Right away, he could see, and he followed Jesus on the path.
