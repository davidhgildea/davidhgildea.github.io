1 When they got close to Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany, by the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his followers.

2 He says to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter, you will see a young donkey tied up that no one has ridden. Untie it and bring it here."

3 If anyone asks you why you are doing this, tell them God needs it, and he will send it right away.

4 They went, found the young donkey tied up outside by a door at a crossroads, and untied it.

5 Some people standing there asked them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"

6 They told them just as Jesus had instructed, and they let them go.

7 They brought the young donkey to Jesus, put their clothes on it, and he sat on it.

8 Many people spread their clothes on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and scattered them on the road.

9 Those who were ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna; blessed is the one who comes in God's name."

10 Let us praise the kingdom of our father David, that comes in God's name: Hosanna in the highest.

11 Jesus went into Jerusalem and the temple. After looking at everything and evening came, he left for Bethany with his twelve disciples.

12 The next day, after they left Bethany, he felt hungry.

13 Seeing a fig tree with leaves from a distance, he went to see if he could find any fruit on it. But when he got there, he found only leaves, because it was not the season for figs.

14 Jesus replied, "From now on, no one will eat your fruit again." His disciples heard this.

15 They came to Jerusalem: Jesus entered the temple and started to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He flipped over the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.

16 He did not allow anyone to carry items through the temple.

17 He taught them, "Isn't it written, my house will be known as a place of prayer for all nations? But you have turned it into a hideout for thieves."

18 The teachers of the law and the leading priests heard what Jesus said and looked for a way to kill him. They were afraid of him because everyone was amazed at his teaching.

19 When evening came, he left the city.

20 In the morning, when they walked by, they saw that the fig tree had withered from the roots.

21 Peter remembered and said to him, "Teacher, look, the fig tree you cursed has withered."

22 Jesus replied, "Trust in God."

23 I tell you the truth, anyone who tells this mountain to move and fall into the sea, and does not doubt but believes what they say will happen, it will be done for them.

24 So I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe you have received it, and it will be yours.

25 When you stand and pray, forgive anyone you have something against, so that God in heaven may forgive your wrongs.

26 If you don't forgive others, God in heaven won't forgive your wrongs.

27 They return to Jerusalem: and while he is walking in the temple, the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders come to him.

28 Tell him, "What authority allows you to do these actions? And who gave you this authority?"

29 Jesus replied, "I have one question for you. Answer me, and I'll tell you by what authority I do these things."

30 Was John's baptism from God or from people? Tell me.

31 They thought to themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"

32 But if we say, "From people," they are afraid of the crowd, because everyone believed John was truly a prophet.

33 They replied to Jesus, "We don't know." And Jesus said to them, "Then I won't tell you with what authority I do these things."
