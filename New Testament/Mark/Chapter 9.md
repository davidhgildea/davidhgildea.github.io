1 He told them, "Truly, I tell you, some standing here won't die before they see God's kingdom come with power."

2 Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a tall mountain alone. There, he changed in appearance before them.

3 His clothes became very bright and white, whiter than anyone in the world could make them.

4 Elias and Moses appeared to them and were talking with Jesus.

5 Peter replied to Jesus, "Teacher, it's good that we are here. Let's make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

6 He did not know what to say because they were very afraid.

7 A cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my dear Son: listen to him."

8 Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one else except Jesus with them.

9 As they came down from the mountain, he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

10 They kept those words to themselves, wondering what "rising from the dead" meant.

11 They asked him, "Why do the teachers say that Elijah must come first?"

12 He replied, "Elijah truly comes first to restore everything; but it is written that the Son of Man must endure many hardships and be ignored."

13 I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.

14 When he came to his disciples, he saw a large crowd around them and the scribes asking them questions.

15 Right away, when the people saw him, they were very surprised and ran up to greet him.

16 He asked the teachers, "What are you discussing with them?"

17 Someone in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son who has a mute spirit."

18 Wherever it takes him, it throws him into fits. He foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes weak. I asked your followers to drive it out, but they couldn't.

19 He replied, "You untrusting people, how much longer must I stay with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."

20 They brought the boy to Jesus, and as soon as the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boy into a fit. He fell to the ground, rolling around and foaming at the mouth.

21 He asked his father, "How long has he had this?" His father replied, "Since he was a child."

22 Many times it has thrown him into the fire and water to kill him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help.

23 Jesus told him, "If you can believe, everything is possible for the one who believes."

24 Right away, the child's father cried out with tears, "God, I believe; help me with my doubt."

25 When Jesus saw the crowd running to join them, he told off the evil spirit, saying, "You silent and hearingless spirit, I command you, come out of him and never go back into him again."

26 The spirit screamed, hurt him badly, and left him. He looked like he was dead, so many people said, "He is dead."

27 Jesus took his hand, helped him up, and he stood.

28 When he entered the house, his followers asked him in private, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"

29 He told them, "This kind can only go out through prayer and fasting."

30 They left that place, traveled through Galilee, and he didn't want anyone to know about it.

31 He taught his followers, telling them, "The Son of Man will be handed over to people, and they will kill him; but after he is dead, he will rise on the third day."

32 But they did not understand what he meant, and were scared to ask him.

33 He came to Capernaum, and in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"

34 But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who should be the most important.

35 He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, they must be last of all and serve everyone."

36 He picked up a child and placed him among them. Holding him in his arms, he said to them,

37 Anyone who welcomes a child like this because of me is also welcoming me. And anyone who welcomes me is not just welcoming me but also the one who sent me.

38 John replied, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons using your name, and he doesn't join us. So we stopped him because he doesn't join us."

39 Jesus said, Do not stop him, because if someone does a miracle in my name, he will not easily say bad things about me.

40 Anyone who is not against us is with us.

41 Anyone who gives you a drink of water because you follow Christ will truly not miss out on their reward.

42 Whoever hurts one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for them to have a heavy stone tied around their neck and to be thrown into the sea.

43 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It's better to live with one hand than to have two hands and go to hell, where the fire never goes out.

44 Their worms never die, and the fire never goes out.

45 If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off: it is better for you to enter life with a limp than to have two feet and be thrown into hell, where the fire never goes out.

46 Their worms never die, and the fire never goes out.

47 If your eye causes you to sin, take it out. It is better to go into God's kingdom with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell fire.

48 Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.

49 Everyone will be purified with fire, and every offering will be seasoned with salt.

50 Salt is good, but if the salt becomes tasteless, how can you make it salty again? Keep salt within you and live peacefully with each other.
