1 As he left the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, look at the size of these stones and these buildings!"

2 Jesus answered him, "Do you see these large buildings? Not one stone will be left on top of another; every one will be thrown down."

3 As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew spoke to him in private.

4 Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that all these things are about to be completed?

5 Jesus replied to them, saying, "Be careful so that no one tricks you."

6 Many will come using my name, claiming they are Christ, and will trick many people.

7 When you hear about wars and talk of wars, don't be worried: these things must happen, but it's not the end yet.

8 One country will fight against another, and one kingdom against another. There will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the first signs of suffering.

9 Be careful: people will hand you over to local courts; you will be whipped in synagogues; and you will stand before leaders and rulers because of me, to prove them wrong.

10 The good news has to be shared with all countries first.

11 When they take you and turn you over, don't worry ahead of time about what to say. Just say what is given to you at that time, because it's not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.

12 Now a brother will betray his brother to death, and a father his son; children will turn against their parents and have them killed.

13 Everyone will hate you because of me, but if you keep going until the end, you will be saved.

14 When you see the terrible thing that causes destruction, as the prophet Daniel talked about, in a place it should not be, (the reader should pay attention,) then those in Judea should run away to the hills.

15 If you are on the roof, do not go down into the house or enter to take anything out.

16 And let the person in the field not go back to get their coat.

17 But it will be hard for pregnant women and those nursing babies in those days!

18 Pray that you don't have to run away during winter.

19 In those days, there will be suffering unlike anything since God created the world, and there will never be anything like it again.

20 If God had not made those days shorter, no one would survive. But for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he has picked, he has made the days shorter.

21 If anyone tells you, "Look, here's Christ," or "There he is," don't believe it.

22 Fake saviors and false prophets will appear and perform miracles and wonders to trick people, if they could, even those chosen by God.

23 Be careful: I have already told you everything.

24 But in those days, after the suffering ends, the sun will become dark, and the moon will not shine.

25 The stars from the sky will fall, and the forces in the sky will be shaken.

26 People will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.

27 Then he will send his angels to collect his chosen people from everywhere on earth to the farthest parts of heaven.

28 Learn from the story of the fig tree: When its branch gets soft and grows leaves, you know that summer is close.

29 In the same way, when you see these things happening, understand that it is close, right at the door.

30 I truly tell you, this generation will not disappear until all these things happen.

31 The sky and the earth will disappear, but my words will never go away.

32 No one knows the day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, only the Father.

33 Be careful, stay alert, and pray, because you do not know when the time will come.

34 The Son of Man is like someone who went on a long trip, left his home, gave his workers power, each one a job, and told the doorkeeper to stay alert.

35 Stay alert, because you don't know when the owner of the house will come back; it could be in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the morning.

36 Be careful that he doesn't come suddenly and find you asleep.

37 I tell you and everyone: Stay alert.
