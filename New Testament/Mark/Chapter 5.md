1 They crossed the sea and reached the land of the Gadarenes.

2 As soon as he stepped out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.

3 He lived among the graves, and no one could tie him up, even with chains.

4 Because he had often been tied up with chains and shackles, and he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles, no one could control him.

5 He was always in the mountains and graves, night and day, yelling and hurting himself with stones.

6 When he saw Jesus from far away, he ran and bowed down to him.

7 He shouted loudly, "Jesus, Son of the highest God, what do you want with me? I beg you in God's name, don't torture me."

8 He told the unclean spirit, "Come out of the man."

9 He asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion, because there are many of us."

10 He begged him a lot not to make them leave the area.

11 Near the mountains there was a large group of pigs eating.

12 All the demons begged him, "Please send us into the pigs, so we can go into them."

13 Immediately, Jesus allowed it. The evil spirits left and went into the pigs. The large group of pigs rushed down the steep hill into the water (there were about two thousand), and they drowned in the water.

14 The people taking care of the pigs ran away and reported this in the town and the countryside. Then everyone came to see what had happened.

15 They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by a demon, who had many inside him, sitting, wearing clothes, and in his clear mind; and they were scared.

16 The people who saw it explained what happened to the man with the demon and about the pigs.

17 They started to ask him to leave their area.

18 When he got into the boat, the man who had been controlled by the evil spirit begged to go with him.

19 However, Jesus did not allow him, but said to him, "Go back to your friends, and tell them about the great things God has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."

20 He left and started to tell everyone in Decapolis about the great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.

21 When Jesus went back by boat to the other side, many people came to him, and he was near the sea.

22 Look, one of the synagogue leaders named Jairus comes, and when he sees Jesus, he falls at his feet.

23 He begged him earnestly, "My young daughter is very sick and close to death. Please come and touch her so she can get better and live."

24 Jesus went with the man, and many people followed and crowded around him.

25 A certain woman had been bleeding for twelve years.

26 She had endured a lot from many doctors, spent all her money, and was not getting better but instead became worse.

27 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes.

28 She thought, "If I can just touch his clothes, I will be healed."

29 Right away her bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was cured of her illness.

30 Jesus immediately felt power had left him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"

31 His followers asked him, "You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"

32 He looked around to see the woman who had done this.

33 The woman, scared and shaking and knowing what had happened to her, came, knelt down before him, and told him the whole truth.

34 He told her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you; go in peace, and be free from your sickness."

35 While he was still talking, someone from the synagogue leader's house came and said, "Your daughter is dead; why bother the Teacher anymore?"

36 As soon as Jesus heard the news, he told the synagogue leader, "Don't be scared, just have faith."

37 He allowed only Peter, James, and John, James's brother, to follow him.

38 He came to the leader's house of the place of worship and saw the commotion, and people crying and wailing a lot.

39 When he came in, he asked them, "Why are you making so much noise and crying? The girl is not dead, but sleeping."

40 They laughed at him. But after sending everyone out, he took the girl's parents and his companions, and went to where the girl was lying.

41 He took the girl's hand and said to her, "Talitha cumi," which means, "Girl, I tell you, get up."

42 Right away the girl got up and walked because she was twelve years old. Everyone was amazed with a huge amazement.

43 He strictly told them to keep it secret and ordered that they give her something to eat.
