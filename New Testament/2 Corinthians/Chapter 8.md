1 Also, friends, we want you to know about the kindness God gave to the churches in Macedonia.

2 They were very joyful in hard times, and though very poor, they were very generous.

3 They gave as much as they could, I can testify, and even beyond their ability, they did it willingly on their own.

4 They asked us earnestly to accept the gift and share in serving the holy people.

5 They did this, not in the way we expected, but they first offered themselves to God, and then to us, because God wanted it that way.

6 We really wanted Titus to complete the good work he started with you.

7 So, as you excel in everything, in faith, speech, knowledge, complete effort, and love for us, make sure you also excel in this kindness.

8 I'm not telling you this as a rule, but to show how eager others are, and to test how genuine your love is.

9 You know about the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, that even though he was rich, he became poor for your sake, so that by his poverty you could become rich.

10 I offer this advice: it is good for you, who started to give last year, to not only continue but also to be eager to finish.

11 So now, do what you have planned; just as you were eager to want to do it, make sure you also complete it with what you have.

12 If someone is willing to give, it is appreciated for what they can afford, not for what they cannot.

13 I don't want others to have it easy while you are burdened.

14 Let there be fairness so your plenty can help others who need it, and in turn, their plenty can help you when you need it, so that everyone has what they need.

15 It is written, whoever collected a lot had nothing extra, and whoever collected a little did not fall short.

16 Thank God, who placed the same sincere concern in Titus's heart for you.

17 He truly welcomed the encouragement, but being more eager, he went to you on his own initiative.

18 We have sent him along with our brother, who is well known in the churches for his work in sharing the good news.

19 And not only that, but he was also picked by the churches to go with us with this kindness, which is given by us for the honor of God, and to show your willingness.

20 We avoid any blame about how we handle this large amount by being careful.

21 Taking care of what is right, not just before God, but also before people.

22 We've sent our brother with them. We've often found he works hard in many things, but now he's even more careful because I trust you a lot.

23 If anyone asks about Titus, he is my partner and helper for you. If they ask about our brothers, they are the church's messengers and show Christ's honor.

24 Show them, and all the churches, how much you love and that we were right to boast about you.
