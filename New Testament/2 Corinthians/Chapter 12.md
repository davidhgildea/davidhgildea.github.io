1 It's not really good for me to boast, but I will talk about visions and messages from God.

2 Fourteen years ago, I knew a man connected to Christ. I don't know if he was in his body or out of it, but God knows. He was taken up to the third heaven.

3 I knew a man, but I'm not sure if it was in the body or out of the body; only God knows.

4 He was taken up to paradise and heard words that cannot be spoken, which no one is allowed to say.

5 I will boast about someone like that, but I won't boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.

6 Even though I might want to boast, I won't be foolish, because I will speak the truth. But I hold back so no one will think more of me than what they see or hear about me.

7 So I wouldn't become too proud because of the great revelations, I was given a pain in my body, a messenger from Satan to beat me down, so I wouldn't become too proud.

8 I asked God three times to take it away from me.

9 He told me, "My kindness is enough for you: my power works best in weakness." So I will most happily take pride in my weaknesses, so that Christ's power can work on me.

10 So I am happy with weaknesses, insults, hard times, persecutions, and troubles for Christ; because when I am weak, then I am strong.

11 I have been foolish to boast, but you made me do it. You should have praised me because I am not less than the top apostles, even though I am nothing.

12 The true marks of an apostle were shown to you with great patience, and through signs, wonders, and powerful acts.

13 What way were you less than other churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Please forgive me for this.

14 Look, I am prepared to visit you for the third time, and I won't be a burden to you. I don't want your things, but I want you. Children shouldn't save up for their parents, but parents should save up for their children.

15 I will happily give everything for you, even if the more I love you, the less you love me.

16 Even though I did not burden you, I was clever and tricked you.

17 Did I profit from you through anyone I sent to you?

18 I asked Titus, and sent a friend with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn't we act in the same way? Didn't we follow the same path?

19 Do you think we are making excuses to you? We are speaking in front of God as we are in Christ: but everything we do, dear friends, is to help you grow.

20 I'm worried that when I come, I may not find you as I wish, and I may be not as you wish. I'm concerned there might be arguments, jealousy, anger, conflicts, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.

21 So when I return, I hope my God does not make me sad in front of you because I may have to mourn for many who have sinned but not changed their ways, or stopped their impure and immoral acts.
