1 I, an older leader, write to the chosen woman and her children, whom I love because we know the truth. Not only I love them, but all who know the truth do too.

2 We live by the truth, and it will always be with us.

3 May grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love.

4 I was very happy to see some of your children living in truth, just as we were commanded by God.

5 Now I ask you, lady, not as if I'm writing a new rule to you, but the one we've had from the start: that we should love each other.

6 Love means following his commands. Keep the command youâ€™ve known from the start: follow it.

7 Many tricksters have come into the world who do not admit that Jesus Christ has come as a human. Such a person is a liar and against Christ.

8 Take care that we don't lose what we have worked for, but that we get the full reward.

9 Anyone who sins and does not follow Christ's teaching does not have God. Whoever follows Christ's teaching has God the Father and the Son.

10 If anyone comes to you and does not teach this message, do not welcome them into your home or wish them well.

11 Anyone who wishes him well shares in his wrong actions.

12 I have a lot to tell you, but I don't want to do it by writing. I hope to visit you soon and talk in person, so we can both be completely joyful.

13 Your chosen sister's children say hello to you. Amen.
