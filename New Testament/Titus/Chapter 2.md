1 Teach what matches with good teaching.

2 Older men should be self-controlled, serious, wise, strong in faith, loving, and patient.

3 Older women should also act in a way that fits with a holy life, not spreading rumors, not drinking too much, and teaching what is good.

4 To help young women be sensible, love their husbands, and love their children.

5 To be wise, pure, take care of their homes, kind, and listen to their husbands, so God's message is not spoken against.

6 Advise young men also to be self-controlled.

7 In everything, be an example of good actions: teach with honesty, seriousness, and truthfulness.

8 Speak clearly and rightly so no one can find fault with you, and those who disagree might feel embarrassed because they can't say anything bad about you.

9 Tell workers to listen to their bosses, try hard to make them happy in everything, and not talk back.

10 Do not steal, but show complete loyalty, so that in everything you may make the teachings of God our Savior attractive.

11 God's grace that offers salvation has been shown to everyone.

12 This teaches us to say no to ungodly ways and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this world.

13 Waiting for the happy hope and the wonderful coming of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ.

14 He gave himself for us, so he could rescue us from all wrongs and clean us for himself, to be his special people who are eager to do good.

15 Talk about these things, encourage others, and correct them with full authority. Don't let anyone look down on you.
