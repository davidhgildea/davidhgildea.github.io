1 My friends, don't all try to be teachers, because we know that we will be judged more strictly.

2 We all make many mistakes. If someone does not make mistakes when they speak, they are perfect and can control their whole body too.

3 Look, we put pieces in horse's mouths so they follow us; we guide their whole body.

4 Look at the ships too. Even though they are big and strong winds push them, a tiny rudder can steer them wherever the pilot chooses.

5 The tongue is small, yet it talks about big things. See how a small fire can start something so huge!

6 The tongue is like a fire; it is full of wrong. It can spoil your whole life and is itself set on fire by hell.

7 Every kind of animal, bird, snake, and sea creature can be tamed and has been tamed by humans.

8 No one can control the tongue; it is a restless evil, filled with deadly poison.

9 We use our words to bless God, the Father, and with those same words, we curse people who are made to look like God.

10 From the same mouth come both blessings and curses. My brothers, this should not be the case.

11 Can a spring pour out both fresh and bitter water from the same opening?

12 My friends, can a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Just as a spring can't give both salty and fresh water.

13 Who is wise and has knowledge among you? Let them show their good actions with a humble attitude that comes from wisdom.

14 If you feel bitter jealousy and conflict in your hearts, don't boast or deny the truth.

15 This wisdom does not come from heaven but is from the earth, appealing to our senses, and evil.

16 Where jealousy and conflict exist, confusion and all kinds of wrong actions are found.

17 The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceful, kind, willing to listen, full of mercy and good actions, fair, and sincere.

18 The good results of right living are planted in peace by those who work for peace.
