1 Paul, a prisoner for Jesus Christ, and Timothy, our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and coworker.

2 To our dear friend Apphia, and Archippus our comrade in arms, and the church that meets in your home:

3 May you have kindness and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ.

4 I thank God, always mentioning you in my prayers.

5 Hearing about your love and faith in Jesus, and for all God's people;

6 May your faith become strong as you realize all the good things we have in Jesus.

7 We are very happy and comforted by your love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of God's holy people.

8 Although I could be confident in Christ to instruct you to do what is right,

9 For love's sake, I prefer to ask you kindly, since I am Paul, an old man, and now also a prisoner for Jesus Christ.

10 I ask you for my son Onesimus, who became my child while I was in chains.

11 Before, this was not useful to you, but now it is useful to both of us.

12 I have sent him back to you, so please welcome him, as he is dear to me.

13 I wanted to keep him with me so he could help me while I am imprisoned for spreading the gospel, doing your work.

14 I wouldn't do anything without your agreement, so your kindness is freely given, not forced.

15 Maybe he left for a while so you could have him back forever.

16 No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a dear brother, especially to me, but even more to you, in person and in God.

17 If you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would me.

18 If he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge it to my account.

19 I, Paul, wrote this with my own hand and will pay it back. But I won't remind you that you owe me your very self as well.

20 Yes, brother, let me find joy in you through God: give me comfort and support in God.

21 Trusting in your willingness to follow, I wrote to you, knowing you will do even more than I ask.

22 Please also get a room ready for me, because I believe that thanks to your prayers, I will be able to come to you.

23 Epaphras, who is in prison with me for following Jesus, sends you greetings.

24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.

25 May the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
