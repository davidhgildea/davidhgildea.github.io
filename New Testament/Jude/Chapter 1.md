1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, writes to those made holy by God the Father, kept safe in Jesus Christ, and chosen.

2 May you receive more and more mercy, peace, and love.

3 Friends, I tried very hard to write to you about the salvation we share. I found it necessary to write, urging you to fight for the faith given to God's holy people once for all.

4 Some men have secretly entered among us, who were already marked long ago for judgement. They are ungodly, misuse God's kindness for immoral behavior, and reject our only God and Lord, Jesus Christ.

5 I will remind you, even though you once knew, that God, after saving the people from Egypt, later destroyed those who did not believe.

6 God has kept the angels who did not stay in their position of authority but left their home in eternal chains in darkness until the day of the great judgment.

7 Just like Sodom and Gomorrah, and the nearby cities, which indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desires, serve as a warning by undergoing punishment with everlasting fire.

8 These dirty dreamers pollute their bodies, reject authority, and insult respected figures.

9 Even Michael the archangel, when arguing with the devil about Moses's body, didn't dare to accuse him harshly, but instead said, "God correct you."

10 They speak badly about what they don't understand, but they act on instinct like wild animals, and it leads to their ruin.

11 Trouble to them! They have followed Cain's path, chased Balaam's mistake for money, and were destroyed arguing like Korah.

12 These are like stains at your love feasts, eating with you without shame, like clouds without rain blown by the wind, or like trees with dried-up fruit, twice dead and uprooted.

13 Wild sea waves, spraying their own shame; wandering stars, for which eternal darkness is kept.

14 Enoch, who was the seventh generation after Adam, spoke of these things, saying, "Look, God is coming with thousands of his holy ones."

15 To carry out judgment on everyone, and to show all the ungodly people their wrong actions they did in an ungodly way, and for all the harsh words ungodly sinners spoke against God.

16 These are grumblers and complainers, living to satisfy their own desires. They brag loudly and flatter others for their own benefit.

17 Friends, remember the words the apostles of Jesus Christ said before.

18 They told you that there would be scoffers in the last days, following their own sinful desires.

19 These are the ones who cause divisions, follow their natural desires, and do not have the Spirit.

20 But friends, build yourselves up in your most sacred faith and pray with the Spirit.

21 Stay in God's love, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you eternal life.

22 Be kind to some, making a change.

23 Save others by scaring them from danger, like pulling them from fire; and hate even clothes stained by sinful lives.

24 To him who can prevent you from falling and make you stand without fault before God with great joy,

25 To the only wise God our Savior, be honor and greatness, authority and strength, both now and forever. Amen.
